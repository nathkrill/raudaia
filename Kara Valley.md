Like a scar across the centre of [[Welcome to Raudaia!|Raudaia]], the Kara valley takes up the central region of the land.
With steep dry mountains to the north and south, the river Kara flows north into a deep, winding valley, where it splits and ends with two salty lakes - Karapal and Karapeth. These landlocked "seas" provide a refreshing cool from the hellish heat that is trapped in the valley, and a good source of livelihood for those who dwell in this valley.
Most settlements lie around the two lakes, leaving an isolated valley in the middle - a place for highwaymen, cultists, and other dangerous things.
