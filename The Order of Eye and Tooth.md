# The Order of Eye and Tooth

![Thief](thief.png)

The Order of the Eye and Tooth act as the architects and masterminds behind the criminal networks in the underworld.

## Purpose

The Order (as most people refer to them as) manage a complex network of spies, thieves, fences, and assassins that operate all over Raudaia.
It's hard to engage in any criminal activity without the involvement of The Order. No robbery, assassination, or shady deal can take place without their resourcing or brokering, enabled by at least one member in each major town and city.

## History

Crime has had a history as long as civilisation in any land. But the mastery of the chaos is owed to the founder of The Order, a mysterious mastermind known as [[The Hooded Prince]].

## Structure

Each "arm" of The Order is managed by an extremely accomplished criminal who manages a sub-network of operatives in their domain. These leaders reside in the secret headquarters of The Order, [[The Nest]]. There is a Nest in every city that The Order operates in, but there are also whispers of a huge secret location where the highest of The Order's leaders work.

The arms are:
#### Whisperers
The Whisperers are the network of spies and informants of The Order. They say there is a Whisperer in every ruling hall in Raudaia.

#### Gatherers
Gatherers are expert thieves, robbers, and extortionists. Any surreptitious way to make coin - they can do.

#### Bloodletters
A merciless team of assassins. This arm has a countless record of contract kills, ranging from political to personal.

#### Gifters
They might sound like a generous group, but the Gifters are in fact some of the most heartless and materialistic people you will meet. Excellent fences and procurers of illegal goods, the Gifters supply and deal with black market trade.

#### Markers
The Markers are the administrators of The Order. They rarely leave their Nest and deal with the members of The Order when it comes to rewards, equipment, and messaging.

## Membership

A lot of The Order's membership are recruited because they are indebted. Their debt is paid off through working more jobs.

Each job is rewarded with a small silver token, given by the leader who gives the job. This token is a small silver tooth with an eye carved into it. 
These tokens are exchanged for payment, and contribute to the member's ranking within the organisation. 
Collecting enough tokens (by *any* means) earns you advancement, and things like the right to put together your own jobs (something that also rewards with tokens) and give out tokens to lesser members who do jobs for you. 
It's a cutthroat environment to work in, but so are the people who work in it!
