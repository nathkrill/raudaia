# The Order of Eye and Tooth

![Thief](thief.png)

The Order of the Eye and Tooth act as the architects and masterminds behind the criminal networks in the underworld.

## Purpose

The Order (as most people refer to them as) manage a complex network of spies, thieves, fences, and assassins that operate all over Raudaia.
It's hard to engage in any criminal activity without the involvement of The Order. No robbery, assassination, or shady deal can take place without their resourcing or brokering, enabled by at least one member in each major town and city.

## History

Crime has had a history as long as civilisation in any land. But the mastery of the chaos is owed to the founder of The Order, a mysterious mastermind known as [[The Hooded Prince]].

## Structure

Each "arm" of The Order is managed by an extremely accomplished criminal who manages a sub-network of operatives in their domain. These leaders reside in the secret headquarters of The Order, [[The Nest]].
The arms are:
#### Whisperers
The Whisperes are the network of spies and informants of The Order. They say there is a Whisperer in every ruling hall in Raudaia.

#### Gatherers
Gatherers are expert thieves, robbers, and extortionists. Any surreptitious way to make coin - they can do.

#### Bloodletters
A merciless team of assassins. This arm has a countless record of contract kills, ranging from political to personal.

#### Gifters
They might sound like a generous group, but the Gifters are in fact some of the most heartless and materialistic people you will meet. Excellent fences and procurers of illegal goods, the Gifters supply and deal with black market trade.
