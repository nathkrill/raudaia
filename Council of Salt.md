The Council of Salt was the fabled meeting of the great beasts of the [[Cult of the Mountains]], where they came together to scheme against their mortal enemies, the [[Nelharim]]. This happened within a generation before [[The Founding]].

The [[Lord of Salt]] was supposedly present at this meeting, and created the religious organisation that worships these dreaded beasts. What purpose he served at this meeting is unknown.
