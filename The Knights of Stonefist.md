The Knights of Stonefist are a clan of warriors set up by the [[Khar]] demigod [[Buraz]].

### Purpose

The Knights of Stonefist work as honorable mercenaries, performing heroic deeds in the name of glory and coin. They mostly operate in the north, close to the [[Witenspire Mountains]].

### History

In his campaigns of battle and heroics, [[Buraz]] the [[Kharparet]] warrior gathered to him the greatest fighters of the kingdom of the [[Khar]] to join him as his "Knights of Stonefist".
Following his departure, the Knights continued to operate as mercenary warriors and expanded their influence and ranks beyond just the dwarven kingdom.
Despite their origins in religion, they are fairly cosmopolitan and their members worship many different gods, or none at all.

### Structure

The Knights operate on an honour system. Performing heroic acts bestows them with an imaginary currency called "War Stones". Those with the most Stones are held as leaders. Stones can be taken away from a member if they fail a mission or do something considered dishonourable by their betters.
