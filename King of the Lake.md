The King of the Lake is the monarch who rules over the kingdom of [[Legaiziripo]]. 
The position is kept by the royal family and is passed down over generations as is seen fit by the current king. 
Sometimes the king abdicates, other times they die. But they always choose their successor from their family. 

In the event that the king does without choosing a successor, there are strict rules for a competition known as [[The Trials of the Lake]] to be undertaken by all members of the next generation of the family. Refusal to participate is punished by execution.
