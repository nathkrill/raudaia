# Wahashka

A Wahashka is a monstrous spider-like creature. It's an evil creature that goes into an intense fury when it's hungry and little can stop it from finding food.

## Description

It's size and strength allows it to crush and smash the terrain around it, and it's many limbs allow it to climb easily. It's body is a bulbous mass and the limbs protrude randomly. At the lower portion of it's body there is a hanging maw.

## Blind

The Wahashka is very limited in it's vision. It relies on sound and movement to see it's prey so staying still, quiet, or far away may give someone a chance to survive an encounter with it.

## The [[Monster in the North]]

The rampaging creature that devastated [[Khizdum]] and other populations in the north was revealed to be a Wahashka.
