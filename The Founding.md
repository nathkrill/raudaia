Recorded history begins with The Founding. There is no precise time in which this began, but it signifies the time in which the scattered people of the land began to join together and civilise. This saw the formation of 7 mostly independent states.

Calendars begin with The Founding, using the notation PF for "Post Founding".

The age of The Founding lasted 150 years, ending with the [[Raffan Conquest]].
## States

The seven states of The Founding, in order of their formation, are:
 - The [[Pevian Holy State]], formed by the [[Nelhahet]].
 - The [[Witnes Conglomerate]], trading state of the [[Khar]].
 - The [[Palerabi]] and [[Legaiziripo]] in the [[Kara Valley]].
 - The blessed [[Gafranthel]] by the river.
 - The seafaring [[Council of Arleans]].
 - The gathered [[Rafah]] tribes at [[Carria]].

## Cultures

This map shows the cultural split of the time. The [[Pevian Holy State|Pevians]] and [[Gafranthel|Gafranthians]] are part of the [[Nelhahet]] culture. The [[Witnes Conglomerate]] are people of the [[Khar]].
The [[Kara]] people are split into the three states of [[Palerabi]], [[Legaiziripo]], and the [[Council of Arleans]].
The nomadic culture of the [[Rafah]] begins to gather at [[Carria]], and their influence dominates the south.

## Religion

The religion at this time is fairly contained to the political and cultural regions of each state. Note that the [[Kara]] are divided in their worship, leading to the two valley states of [[Palerabi]] and [[Legaiziripo]] forming a tense rivalry over the sacred valley.

## Politics

```

The states of this time mostly ignore one another, with the exception of [[Gafranthel]] and [[Pevian Holy State|Pevia]], where [[Gafranthel]] relies mostly on [[Pevian Holy State|Pevia]] for jurisdiction, and [[Legaiziripo]] and [[Palerabi]] who are engaged in a fierce rivalry over the [[Kara Valley]]. This often results in skirmishes in the mountains, but not all out war (yet).
[[Legaiziripo]] maintains trade with [[Council of Arleans|Arleans]], but eager to avoid the religious and political entanglement [[Council of Arleans|Arleans]] keeps it's distance.

The state of things in this time is mostly peaceful, but with each state trying to grow it's borders, commerce, and culture, it wouldn't take much to spark animosity between any two nations.

During this time, the [[Carria]] are mostly unknown. While the presence of desert people is known, the other states are unaware of a gathering of tribes beginning in the south.

## Currency

Bartering and trade are well practiced during this time. The small nations trade with each other in limited capacity. The Founding sees the beginning of the use of small tokens of precious metal as forms of currency.

## Technology

The technology at the time of The Founding is comparable to the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age of our world. The use of the wheel and sail are well established as modes of transport, and weapons are formed of common metals.
Complex gears and machinery is yet to be invented.
