## Council of the Mystics

![Mystic mage](mage.png)

The Council of the Mystics are a traditional group of magic practitioners who set themselves up as the governing authority of magic across Raudaia.

## Purpose

The Mystics serve many purposes but each of them focuses on the use and development of magic. They investigate magical phenomena, guide and train budding mages, and offer magical services to those who can pay their high rates.

## History

The origins of the mystics is not entirely known to the general populous. Rumours are that in the early days of magical influence on the world, the very first council came together to understand and contain the essence of magic, and melded it into the practices of many mages today.

## Structure

The faction is highly academic. Status and position are granted by peer-status based on arcane achievement and discovery. This could come from the development of new magics, the finding of mystical artefacts, or defeat of the magical monstrosities sometimes found across Raudaia.
Sometimes the more crafty mages come by power through manipulating others to perform these tasks on their behalf.
The leading council itself is made up of the most powerful few, and it is very rare for new leaders to be chosen.

Any person who finds themselves possessing magical prowess must present themselves to their nearest representatives in order to be registered and trained. They maintain a teaching campus, centre of archive, and research in the far west of Raudaia called the [[Library of Ages]].
