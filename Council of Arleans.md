Arleans is an independent state of the [[Kara]] people. Formed during [[The Founding]], it was made up of a group that was dissatisfied with living in the [[Kara Valley]] with it's petty squabbled, and so they seceded to the cooler coasts in the east. 

Their state is mostly a commercial culture, with fishing and shipping forming a large part of their economy. The state is run by a council, who are made up of local leaders and business folk. 

Arleans have strong ties with their neighbours [[Legaiziripo]] as they share a religion and culture, although they are much less zealous than those who dwell in the valley. They also trade heavily with the [[Khar]].
