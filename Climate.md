# Climate

The [[Welcome to Raudaia!|Raudaian]] landmass is located spanning the equator of the globe. This results in a generally warm climate, and not so many [[Seasons|seasons]].

The coasts are lined by tropical forests and rainforests, where most of the rain falls. These give way to wide savannahs, with deserts occupying most of the centre of the land.

Further north, the temperature drops significantly, as the globe's northern hemisphere is largely ice, and cool winds bring chilled temperatures. A freezing, dry [[Starved Wastes|wasteland]] can be found just south of the [[Witenspire Mountains|Witenspire]] mountain range, and there is a subarctic forest to the north of them.

South East is a vast [[Alkhara Desert|desert]]. This is a barren dunic landscape with little life.
