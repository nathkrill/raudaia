# Friella's Fruits

Friella's Fruits is a small fruit shack in a fork in the road just north of [[Cambroke]] in the [[Western Horn]]. 

Though it appears as a humble fruit stand, Friella's is in fact a front for a sect of the [[Cult of the Mountains]] who used it to kidnap unwary travellers for use in sacrificial rituals.
