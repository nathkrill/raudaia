### Khar

![Khar](khar.png)

The mostly Dwarven people of Khar reside in the foreboding [[Witenspire Mountains|Witenspite Mountains]]. Their great halls are built under the mountains themselves, and stretch deep beneath the surface.
They pride themselves on their craftsmanship and trade, even so much that their leaders are a conglomerate of mining operators.
Whilst a strong and sometimes powerful people, they do not enjoy war, as that interferes with their trade.
