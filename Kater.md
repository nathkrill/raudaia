# Kater Bladwin

Kater is a human soldier who serves as captain of the guard in [[Issren]].

Seemingly one of few guards in the town who are not in the employ of the [[Bandits in the Tunnel]], she was impressed by [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]]'s efforts in taking them out.
