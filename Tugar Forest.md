### Tugar Forest

![Tugar Forest](tugar.png)

In the furthest north of [[Welcome to Raudaia!|Raudaia]] lies a deep pine forest, blanketed with snow. The endless lines of trees make for a dangerous and confusing terrain to travel in.
The deepest parts of these woods are rumoured to be the home of many foul beings like witches, hags, and giant spiders.
