Gafranthel is a [[Nelhahet]] state at the time of [[The Founding]]. It is a vassal of the [[Pevian Holy State]] and relies on them for much of its jurisdiction. 

Their capital city of [[Ebesia]] is a long, narrow city that dominates the southern shore of the central [[Umrion Valley|Umrion River]].
## The Founding

As the [[Pevian Holy State]] was being formed, there were many [[Nelhahet]] who did not approve of the organisation of the religious state. As such, they made their own nation deep in the middle of the [[Umrion Valley]]. Whilst claiming independence, they relied much on their parent state, but provided for them useful trade and resource. They mostly disagree with the decrees of the [[Neo-Nelhar]] and practice a less orthodox religious practice.
