### Alkhara Desert

The majorative portion of the South and East region of Raudaia is the Alkhara Desert. This dry landscape of dunes and canyons is a desolate place, but some still make it home. A few oasis can be found, and there is in the centre a solitary mountain, which is a sacred site for the nomadic desert people of the [[Rafah]].
Surviving in the desert is hard, as it seems every element in this scorched sea of sand is willing against you.
