The Witnes Conglomerate are a nation of the [[Khar]]. Their borders mostly lie high in the [[Witenspire Mountains]], with some parts stretching south. 

Their political structure is made of a conglomerate of mining bosses, who lead a productive capitalist society. 

## The Founding

At some point during [[The Founding]], the dwarven mines joined forces in order to solidify trade with the other emerging nations. Their trade with the nation of [[Gafranthel]] and the [[Kara]] people was successful, but the [[Pevian Holy State|Pevians]] shunned them and offered them little movement in their territories.
