Enugar is a town guard of [[Issren]]. He was secretly in the employ of the [[Bandits in the Tunnel]], until [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] killed them off and had him arrested. 

Two of Enugar's friends attempted to threaten [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]], altering him to potential further corruption within the guard.

Enugar organised a coup and took control of [[Issren]]. During the conflict that followed he attempted to flee with stores of treasure, but was intercepted and killed by [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]]. It was discovered that Enugar was secretly in correspondence with the mayor of [[Issren]].
