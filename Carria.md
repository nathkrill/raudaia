Carria is a collection of [[Rafah]] tribes in the western [[Alkhara Desert]].

Around the time of [[The Founding]], many tribes began to dwell here, united by their devotion to [[Falah]]. 
An unofficial state was created - with no leader or structure, but they began to trade with members of the northern states, becoming in their mind a nation.
