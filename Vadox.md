## Vadox

![Vadox](vadox.png)

[[Vadox]] is not worshipped as a god by the [[Nelhahet]]. He is the eternal foe of the [[Nelharim]], having betrayed them and slayed others of their kin. He is portrayed in myth as a vast shadow, or a dark mountainous being.
Some of the more extreme worshippers of the [[Nelharim]] believe that the monstrous gods of the [[Cult of the Mountains]] are beings created by Vadox's dark magic, while others are suspicious of the [[Rafah]] god [[Falah]], believing he is a new incarnation of Vadox.
