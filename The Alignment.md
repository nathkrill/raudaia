# The Alignment 

The alignment marks the end of the Raudaian year. This occurs every 496 days when the three [[Astronomy#Moons|moons]] form a vertical line in the sky, usually early evening. The following day is the first day of [[Calendar|Nualfa]] and the new year. 

The first cross-Raudaia celebration of The Alignment is what marked the beginning of the year of [[The Founding]], and the start of recorded history in Raudaia.
