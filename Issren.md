The town of Issren is the most eastern settlement into the [[Emerald Coast]]. A frontier town, it serves as a stronghold to protect civilians from the wild jungles around it.

Due to it's proximity to the coast, it often has dealings with pirates and raiders that dwell in the jungles. As such, it's mayor is quite rich from ill-gotten gains and many fences and thieves can be found lurking in the taverns and trading halls.
Most of it's outgoing trade is sent upriver to [[Leeyaz]], either by cart or small boats. Officially it's produce is dense jungle wood, but contraband regularly finds it's way amongst the lumber.

#### Bumpy Shroom Tavern

[[Quentin McQuall]] witnessed Ka'Eek being robbed whilst drinking in this tavern and agreed to sort out his problem in exchange for free board.
