The yellow [[Gods of the Valley|God of the Valley]]. Kagan is god of all things light. The sun, gold, honey, and wealth are usually his. The reason he is less powerful despite his domains is because he is fleeting and fanciful. He is a deceitful god, and loves practical jokes. His followers wear quartz and topaz, and they will often trade fool's gold to their enemies.
