The Hooded Prince is the mysterious figure credited with taming the criminal activity of the early world into [[The Order of Eye and Tooth]].

Presumably long dead, The Hooded Prince was supposedly an accomplished thief and mastermind who with fame and the spoils of his exploits managed to build a group responsible for managing all criminal activity in Raudaia.
