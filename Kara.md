As the name suggests, the Kara people originate in the [[Kara Valley|Kara Valley]]. A race of humans, they are hot-headed and salty people - to match their place of origin! Their culture is lively and colourful. They take pride in the dyeing of cloths and clothes.

Most Kara livelihood comes from fishing the lakes, although they are also known to shepherd the hills and fields on the outskirts of the valley.

Some Kara live very sheltered and isolated lives high in the mountains of the valley. Here they worship strange and old gods, and some even dabble in dark magics.

## States

The notable states of the Kara are [[Legaiziripo]], [[Palerabi]], and [[Council of Arleans|Arleans]]. These three states were formed at [[The Founding]].

## Religions

At [[The Founding]], the Kara were divided into two, separated by the gods they worship. The Western Kara formed the [[Cult of the Mountains]], whereas the Eastern Kara worship the [[Gods of the Valley]].
