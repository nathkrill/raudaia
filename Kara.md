### Kara

As the name suggests, the Kara people originate in the [[Kara Valley|Kara Valley]]. A race of humans, they are hot-headed and salty people - to match their place of origin!
Most Kara livelihood comes from fishing the lakes, although they are also known to shepherd the hills and fields on the outskirts of the valley.
Some Kara live very sheltered and isolated lives high in the mountains of the valley. Here they worship strange and old gods, and some even dabble in dark magics.
