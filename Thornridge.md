# Thornridge

Thronridge is a rugged highland area in the [[Elerion Woods]],
west of the[[ River of Reeds]], forming a natural barrier between the deepwood and the forgotten western territories.

## Geography & Terrain

A craggy stretch of jagged hills and broken ridgelines, covered in tangled undergrowth, bone-white rocks, and barbed thickets. The ridges are steep and uneven, with occasional sinkholes, gullies, and hollowed-out caves; many of which are uncharted.

The region is laced with blackthorn groves, whose gnarled, twisting limbs seem to grow into shapes reminiscent of hands, faces, or reaching antlers. Fog tends to settle here without cause, clinging to hollows and ravines like forgotten breath.

## History 

Once a sacred hunting ground for elven pathfinders and spirit-seekers, known for its dream-thorns: plants that caused visions or trance-states when burned or brewed.

After the exile of several rogue enchanters centuries ago, the area was left unpatrolled, and the land was said to shift of its own will.

Several old waystones, eroded and half-swallowed by root and vine, still stand, etched in the spiral language of the forgotten courts.
