# The Nest 

Every regional headquarters of [[The Order of Eye and Tooth]] is called "The Nest". But in fact there is a Nest hidden somewhere in Raudaia that houses the top leaders of The Order, as well as a vast amount of wealth.

Only the most accomplished members of The Order are given the location of The Nest, and even then they have to navigate a complex series of traps and danger to enter.
