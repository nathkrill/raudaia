# River of Reeds

This river flows through the [[Elerion Woods]] east of Aerrin’s forge and near the foothills of [[Thornridge]].

The River of Reeds winds like a silver thread through the forest, its waters always calm, its current deceptively slow. It's flanked by tall, whispering reeds that seem to lean toward those who speak near them, as if listening or remembering.

It is not wide, but deep, and its banks are littered with the remains of forgotten offerings: cracked masks, carved stones, old weapon hilts, and faded prayer tokens.

## Memory-Soaked Waters

[[Nelhahet]] culture says the river remembers things cast into it. Some rituals suggest it can hold emotions, even preserve names long after they’ve been spoken for the last time.
Elves who are exiled but die in the forest are often laid to rest near the river, unmarked, to be forgotten in life but remembered by the water.

## Spiritual Boundary

It’s believed to separate the mortal wood from the “Echoing Veil,” a liminal realm where lost thoughts and bound spirits drift. Some believe spirits gather at the river’s edge before crossing over.

## Reed Whispers

When the wind moves through the reeds, it’s said you can hear your name or the name of someone you’ve wronged. Many exiles avoid it for this reason.

## Rare Flora

The [[Blackroot Bark]] grows only along its shadiest stretches, where the water flows over submerged ruins.

[[The Circle]] is rumored to use the river as a silent communication channel—placing bound leaves into it that carry cryptic messages downstream to those who know how to read them.
