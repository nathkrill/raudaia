The weakest of the seven [[Gods of the Valley]], [[Shal]] is depicted as a grumpy old man. He is often mocked by the others, and is associated with rage and anger. Despite this, he is a sensitive soul and is not malicious. He is considered to be righteous and a champion of justice. His symbols are rubies and the colour red.
