# The Circle

The Circle is a clandestine order of watchers, lorekeepers, and guardians who concern themselves not with power, politics, or conquest—but with the preservation and containment of "instruments of consequence."

These are people, artifacts, spells, or even ideas capable of shifting the balance of the world—not through brute strength, but through their potential to rewrite the rules others live by.

## Core Beliefs

- Not All Truths Should Be Known.  
    The Circle believes that some knowledge is too dangerous or disruptive for mortal or immortal hands. They document it, archive it, and lock it away in places even gods forget.
    
- Power Must Be Observed, Not Used.  
    They do not wield the artifacts or magic they preserve. They study it. Record it. Seal it. Witness it. And, if needed, neutralize it.
    
- Balance Must Be Maintained.  
    Their ultimate goal is to maintain a delicate equilibrium between progress and collapse—not peace, not justice, but balance. If someone, or something, threatens that balance, The Circle intervenes—quietly, permanently.

## Methods and Practices

- **Witnesses**: Individuals sent to observe major events, creations, or individuals. They rarely speak, and even more rarely act. Their presence alone is a warning.
    
- **Preservers**: Scholars and arcane archivists who catalogue dangerous lore. Their libraries are sealed and hidden—often in ruins, vaults, or living beings.
    
- **Hands of the Circle**: When observation is no longer enough, they send operatives to retrieve, seal, or eliminate the threat. They are rarely seen—and never leave loose ends.
