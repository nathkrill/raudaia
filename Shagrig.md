![Shagrig](shagrig.png)

The god of gluttony, flesh, and decay. His form is a mountainous being of tormented flesh, with many faces and limbs protruding from his decaying skin. He loves blood and violence, and will grant his followers the means to torture and maim their enemies.

Many of his followers carry around with them small pouches with fresh meat or organs in them.
