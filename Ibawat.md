## Ibawat

![Ibawat](ibawat.png)

Ibawat holds the domain of death and the undead. Followers come to him to try to gain long life, or to resurrect their loved ones.  The blessings he grants are often hollow and cursed.
In his cave, he resides as an immense pile of bones, which he can form into many horrific shapes.
