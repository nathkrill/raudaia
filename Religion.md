# Religion

The cultures of [[Welcome to Raudaia!|Raudaia]] are mainly defined by their religious beliefs. Each culture has at least one set of beliefs.

## The [[Nelharim]]

The organised religion of the [[Nelhahet]] people. This is a polytheist religion mainly made up of giant-like beings who provide for their every need. The religious centre is the rivers of the [[Umrion Valley]].

## The [[Kharparet]]

The [[Khar]] have folk traditions of a group of gods who resemble dwarves, but hold special powers and are reincarnated in champions over time.

## The [[Cult of the Mountains]]

The western people of the [[Kara]] have a religious cult, who worship in sacred caves high in the mountains. Each cave is supposed to be home to a different legendary beast, who crave sacrifice and donation.

## The [[Gods of the Valley]]

The eastern [[Kara]] have a more traditional folk religion, where they pray to colourful entities who can grant blessings, or bestow curses. A very unorganised set of beliefs, as rooted in colour means there can be a lot of crossover, and the list is ever-changing. The colours of the rainbow seem to be the most stable set.

## [[Falah]], The Unchanging

Deep in the [[Alkhara Desert]] is a solitary mountain. Here, the [[Rafah]] are supposed to have met their god, [[Falah]]. In the ever-changing region of the desert, he is their rock. All other gods are falsehoods, and the [[Rafah]] believe he will one day wipe them out and hand over the land of [[Welcome to Raudaia!|Raudaia]] to them.
