Bloola is the leader of [[The Circus]]. 
She is a tall, strong Faun. She doesn't take any nonsense and can be quite hotheaded at times. 

She was the first to confront the [[Leeyaz]] guards who came to the camp in [[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Journals/Scene 1]]. Quentin witnessed her falling to a guard's sword.
