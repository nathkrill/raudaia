# Jane Halliwell

Jane is a soldier in the city of [[Cambroke]].
She is from noble descent, divorced, and in her 60s.
She's a pessimistic person, and a bad liar.

She reached out to [[The Order of Eye and Tooth]] to recover (steal) an item from her recently-ex-husband which she greatly coveted in the divorce proceedings but wasn't able to get.
