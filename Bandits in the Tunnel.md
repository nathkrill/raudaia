# The Bandits in the Tunnel

The [[Bandits in the Tunnel]] are a mixed group of bandits who terrorized the town of [[Issren]]. Their name comes from their dwelling - a tunnel in the city walls that leads out into the forest.

[[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] took out the bandits, only to learn that they were more widespread than he thought, having a few [[Issren]] guards in their employ, as well as many spies.
