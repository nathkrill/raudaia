# The Bandits in the Tunnel

The [[Bandits in the Tunnel]] are a mixed group of bandits who terrorized the town of [[Issren]]. Their name comes from their dwelling - a tunnel in the city walls that leads out into the forest.

[[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] took out the bandits, only to learn that they were more widespread than he thought, having a few [[Issren]] guards in their employ, as well as many spies.
The remaining town guards took control of the city, only to be overthrown by the efforts of [[Kater]] and [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]].

They discovered that the mayor of [[Issren]] had been secretly financing the bandits.
