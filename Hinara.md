## Hinara

![Hinara](hinara.png)

Hinara is the master of secrets, lies, and forbidden knowledge. She is a giant spider. She loves tangled webs of manipulation, and uses her children as spies to learn the many secrets of the world. Her worshippers hope that their sacrifice and offering will buy them a place in her plans and machinations, and grant them insight and access to her secrets.
