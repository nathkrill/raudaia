Qatu is a great salamander. He loves the shadows, and craves treasure. His worshippers are often thieves and assassins, who bring him stolen treasures in return for the rewards that aid their stealth and infiltration. He is known to send out groups to recover lost artefacts and great hordes for him. He also craves the knowledge of [[Hinara]], who knows of secret vaults and lost treasures of old.
