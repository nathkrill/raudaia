# Glacial Mind

The Glacial Mind is a magical artifact that was discovered deep in the [[Starved Wastes]].
Somehow, it ended up in the posession of [[The Ribbon in the Sand]], who arranged for it to be sold to a buyer in [[Asmadah]].
[[Temitope]] was a scholar who was tasked with delivering the item, with the help of [[Greeba]], [[Snake]], and [[Rat Scratch]].

## Appearance

About the size of a melon, the Glacial Mind looks like a large, glowing ice crystal. It is mildly cool to the touch. The light it gives off is dim, but draws the attention of any within eyesight.
