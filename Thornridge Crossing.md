# Thornridge Crossing

The crossing is a narrow gorge & bridge pass west of [[Aerrin]]â€™s forge, threading through the [[Thornridge]] Hills. It's a vital passage across rough terrain, linking deeper forest routes with the outer wilderness and long-forgotten roads.

The Crossing lies above a sharp, narrow gorge carved by glacial movement and rainwater over centuries. A rope-and-wood footbridge, weathered, mossy, but still functional spans the divide.

The gorge itself hums with a strange echo; shouting into it causes delayed responses, as if the gorge chooses when to return your voice.

## History
Once part of a trade route between [[Nelhahet]] waystations and [[Kara]] outposts, the trail fell into disuse after the [[Kara]] split into the two nations. Now it's used only by outcasts, scouts, and scholars, and occasionally by [[The Circle]] operatives moving unseen between paths.

Rumored to have been the site of a duel between a rogue spellbinder and a hunter of echoes. Locals say that blood soaked into the earth there still warps dreams when you sleep nearby.

At certain dawns, the sun hits the gorge at the perfect angle to reflect off old stone below and project a sigil of flame on the bridge. No one knows what it means.
