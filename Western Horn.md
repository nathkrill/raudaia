### Western Horn

![Western Horn](western-horn.png)

To the west is the uncivilised region known as the Western Horn. Named by it's coastal protrusion, this region has never hosted any major civilisation and as such is a dangerous and uncharted place.
People do live here, as evidenced from afar by roads and towns, but they are supposed to be cruel and selfish people. Many who are exiled from the central regions find their way here.
The horn begins as a savannah, which breaks into a thick rainforest as you reach the apex.
