A rogue dwarf member of [[The Circus]]. 
Inma is a compassionate sort, always looking out for his fellow performers. 

His act is an escape artist routine. He can wriggle and pick his way out of almost anything. 

He backed up [[Bloola Steel]] alongside [[Quentin McQuall]] when [[Leeyaz]] guards came to camp in [[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Journals/Scene 1]]. He fell to a guard's arrow.
