# Mazael

These horrific beasts are large and wolf-like, except they have no skin and their skeleton sits partially outside their bodies. 

They are frenzied hunters and killers, hunting and brutalizing anything they find. They often hunt in packs but quickly turn to killing their own kind if food is scarce.
