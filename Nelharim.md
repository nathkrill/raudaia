This set of deities forms the organised religion of the [[Nelhahet]] people. They form temples and erect statues of their gods, each of which is supposed to bring different blessings and provisions for their people.

Nelharim in the [[Nelhahet]] tongue literally means "Noble Ones". Each deity takes the form of a giant humanoid creature. They are benevolent beings. The [[Nelhahet]] see other deities as evil, particularly the [[Cult of the Mountains|Karran mountain cult]].

The sacred centre of this religion is the waters of the [[Umrion Valley]]. It is said that the Nelharim carved the river as both protection from the heat of the south, as well as provision of life apart from the frozen wastes of the north. The waters are sacred, and many religious rites involve bathing in the rivers. Some [[Nelhahet]] even choose to give birth in the shallows of the river, giving their priests the name "Waterborne".

The [[Pevian Holy State]] is ruled by a religious oligarchy that revere the Nelharim. They have a strict ban against the worship of any other gods, and will regularly persecute and sometimes execute religious leaders who encourage the worship of so-called false gods.

Most other religions believe the Nelharim are real, but don't regard them as objects of worship. The religion of the [[Kharparet]] have ancient stories of their champions waging war against great colossi, but they don't see them as threats any more. 

## [[Eahethel]]

The supreme deity of the Nelharim. [[Eahethel]] takes the form of an immense Yeti. His preferred dwelling is the [[Tugar Forest]]. He brings the blessing of warmth from the cold climate, and is sometimes associated with fire.

## [[Neirenor]]

The goddess of the natural world and plant life. She takes the form of a giant walking tree. She provides shade and shelter from natural disasters.

## [[Ulumeras]]

The god of the deep waters of the sea. His gift is fruit of the sea and cool waters.
He takes the form of a sea-giant, with a large crab claw at the end of his left arm.

## [[Shemlana]]

[[Shemlana]] is goddess of the winds. She stands at the edge of the desert, and blows southern winds to drive away the heat. She takes the form of a mass of blowing cloths and sand.

## [[Himnes]]

A giant cyclops. [[Himnes]] is god of the mountains and rocks. He is less revered, as his gifts of minerals and stones are not very valuable to the [[Nelhahet]].

## [[Vadox]]

[[Vadox]] is not worshipped as a god by the [[Nelhahet]]. He is the eternal foe of the Nelharim, having betrayed them and slayed others of their kin. He is portrayed in myth as a vast shadow, or a dark mountainous being.
Some of the more extreme worshippers of the Nelharim believe that the monstrous gods of the [[Cult of the Mountains]] are beings created by [[Vadox|Vadox's]] dark magic, while others are suspicious of the [[Rafah]] god [[Falah]], believing he is a new incarnation of [[Vadox]].
