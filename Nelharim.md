This set of deities forms the organised religion of the [[Nelhahet]] people. They form temples and erect statues of their gods, each of which is supposed to bring different blessings and provisions for their people.

Nelharim in the [[Nelhahet]] tongue literally means "Noble Ones". Each deity takes the form of a giant humanoid creature. They are benevolent beings. The [[Nelhahet]] see other deities as evil, particularly the [[Cult of the Mountains|Karran mountain cult]].

The sacred centre of this religion is the waters of the [[Umrion Valley]]. It is said that the Nelharim carved the river as both protection from the heat of the south, as well as provision of life apart from the frozen wastes of the north. The waters are sacred, and many religious rites involve bathing in the rivers. Some [[Nelhahet]] even choose to give birth in the shallows of the river, giving their priests the name "Waterborne".

The [[Pevian Holy State]] is ruled by a religious oligarchy that revere the Nelharim. They have a strict ban against the worship of any other gods, and will regularly persecute and sometimes execute religious leaders who encourage the worship of so-called false gods.
