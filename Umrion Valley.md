### Umrion Valley

![Umrion Valley](umrion.png)

Not a valley in the traditional sense, the Umrion river spans the width of the northern part of [[Welcome to Raudaia!|Raudaia]], separating off the chilly regions of the north.
The river provides a lush and bountiful strip that is enclosed by the deserts of the lower north.
The ancestral home of [[Nelhahet]] elvenkind, this "valley" is considered sacred to the elves, who will fight to protect it at all costs.
