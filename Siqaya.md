# Siqaya

The Siqaya is a small lizard creature that can be found in dusty parts of the [[Alkhara Desert]]. They often congregate in towns and villages to take shade.

They are known in the [[Alkhara Desert]] for their small, sweet, and colourful eggs. These are a delicacy often served to guests or at celebrations.
