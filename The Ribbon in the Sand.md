# The Ribbon in the Sand

![Ribbon Store](ribbonstore.png)

The Ribbon in the Sand is a trade franchise based out of the [[Kara Valley]]. 

### Purpose

The Ribbon manages most of the trade and goods dealing in and out of the [[Kara Valley]]. They have large trade outposts at each end of the valley. Some of their network make frequent trips into the [[Alkhara Desert]].

### History

The Ribbon has its roots in cross-desert trade between tribes before [[The Founding]]. It's name comes from the practice of ancient traders who used to stake ribbon into the sand to navigate the wilderness. 

### Structure

A mostly flat organisational structure, The Ribbon members mostly serve themselves, paying small franchise fees in order to access the goods stores and pedigree associated with The Ribbon. 

There is a leader, [[The Counter]]. He manages the trade stores and franchises in the network. He also charters trade missions to new territories. At the time of [[The Founding]], [[Zasan Q'ortell]] is [[The Counter]].
