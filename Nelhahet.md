The Nelhahet people are an elven people, born in the sacred [[Umrion Valley]]. Their culture is built around the worship of their pantheon known as the [[Nelharim]] (The Noble Ones).
Their livelihood is focussed on the river. Fishing, barging, and milling are common professions amongst the Nelhahet.
They live in long, wooden cities that spread across banks of their precious river.
Some intrepid groups of Nelhahet have ventured north into the [[Tugar Forest|Tugar Forest]], and built logging settlements there.

Cultural cities of the Nelhahet include [[Pevian Holy State|Pevia]] and [[Gafranthel]].
