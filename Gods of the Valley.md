The numerous members of the [[Kara]] Pantheon are defined by colour. As a result, their domains are often overlapping and there are always new ones being added. Their domains can be almost anything, but are usually led by emotion.
The most common worshipped, and most consistent, are the seven colours of the rainbow, a symbol that is used to generally represent the Gods of the Valley.

Worship of these gods in the day to day is simple - things associated with each god's domain are often wrapped or covered in their colour, therefore blessing it. The people also wear their chosen god's colour proudly.
Several times in a year, huge festivals are held, where coloured banners and flags are displayed, and people dress up and paint themselves in many colours.

Worship of the Valley Gods is what united the [[Kara]] of the east to form the state of [[Legaiziripo]], hence why their banners hold the symbol of the rainbow.

The power and renown of the seven is in reverse order, with the [[Atum]] the Violet as the leader, and [[Shal]] the Red as the lesser. When these gods manifest themselves, they are often tall figures, wearing brightly coloured robes and sashes, and usually with many gems adorning them. They are not too dissimilar in manner and appearance to the djiin.

## [[Atum]] (Violet)

[[Atum]] is the leader of the seven. His symbols are amethyst and purple flowers. As all the valley gods, his domain is ever shifting, but he is characterised as a benevolent and charming figure, often associated with romance.

## [[Durmo]] (Indigo)

A deeper and darker brother of [[Atum]]. He is most associated with heartbreak and loneliness. He has a brooding persona.

## [[Jarbi]] (Blue)

A wise and wistful character, [[Jarbi]] is most known for her dreams and charms. She can also be associated with water due to her colour. Her gems are opal and sapphire.

## [[Ituna]] (Green)

[[Ituna]] has a vast domain. Due to the major appearance of green in nature she is often seen as a goddess of life and growth. To some she can be the herald of sickness and poison. That sickness extends to the mind, with emotions like greed and jealousy. Emerald is her gem.

## [[Kagan]] (Yellow)

[[Kagan]] is god of all things light. The sun, gold, honey, and wealth are usually his. The reason he is less powerful despite his domains is because he is fleeting and fanciful. He is a deceitful god, and loves practical jokes. His followers wear quartz and topaz, and they will often trade fool's gold to their enemies.

## [[Nituma]] (Orange)

The sister of [[Ituna]]. [[Nituma]] is converse to her sister as she holds the domain of created things. Art, music, and crafts are what she delights in. Due to the emotional range of her domain, she often courts the other gods, drawing inspiration from them.

## [[Shal]] (Red)

The weakest of the seven, [[Shal]] is depicted as a grumpy old man. He is often mocked by the others, and is associated with rage and anger. Despite this, he is a sensitive soul and is not malicious. He is considered to be righteous and a champion of justice. His symbols are rubies.
