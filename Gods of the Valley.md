The numerous members of the [[Kara]] Pantheon are defined by colour. As a result, their domains are often overlapping and there are always new ones being added. Their domains can be almost anything, but are usually led by emotion.
The most common worshipped, and most consistent, are the seven colours of the rainbow, a symbol that is used to generally represent the Gods of the Valley.

Worship of these gods in the day to day is simple - things associated with each god's domain are often wrapped or covered in their colour, therefore blessing it. The people also wear their chosen god's colour proudly.
Several times in a year, huge festivals are held, where coloured banners and flags are displayed, and people dress up and paint themselves in many colours.

Worship of the Valley Gods is what united the [[Kara]] of the east to form the state of [[Legaiziripo]], hence why their banners hold the symbol of the rainbow.

The power and renown of the seven is in reverse order, with the [[Atum]] the Violet as the leader, and [[Shal]] the Red as the lesser. When these gods manifest themselves, they are often tall figures, wearing brightly coloured robes and sashes, and usually with many gems adorning them. They are not too dissimilar in manner and appearance to something like a djiin.

The Valley religion is mostly ignored by other cultures. Those who have encountered them are often convinced they are demons or desert spirits.
