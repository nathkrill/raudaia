# Hataqat

Hataqat is a small town at the very western edge of the [[Kara Valley]]. It doesn't have much note except as a common launching off point for trade missions into the [[Alkhara Desert]].

Hataqat is also known for it's castle, which has a triple porticullis that features heavily in the town's symbology.
