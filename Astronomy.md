# Astronomy

The continent of [[Welcome to Raudaia!|Raudaia]] takes up just over one third of the planet it is on. It is a mostly equatorial continent. Not much is known about other landmasses on the planet. 

The people of Raudaia are in the dark about the rest of the world, and as such they refer to the entire globe as Raudaia. 

## The Sun 

Raudaia has a single sun, which shines bright and hot on the land, which is what results in the dry climate across the majority of the continent. This impacts the [[Seasons]] in Raudaia.

## Moons 

Raudaia has three moons, which circle the planet each on their own path. Once every 496 days towards the beginning of summer the moons line up in the sky, usually early in the evening. This event, know as [[The Alignment]], marks the end of the year in Raudaia. The night that follows is a night full of celebration and revelry - each culture does this in a unique way. 

Each culture in Raudaia also have their own mythology and ideas behind the purpose of the moons.

### Sofensa 

Sofensa is the first moon of the night. She appears in early evening, often glowing pink in the light of the sunset. She is smaller than the other moons, but reflects a warm golden light across the lower portions of the night sky. Her face is a pure, smooth surface. 

### Nenassa 

Nenassa is the primary moon that circles Raudaia. He often appears with Sofensa but shines a clear white light throughout the night. He sits higher in the sky. His face is rough, and shows a long scar across his lower region. 

### Irissen 

Irissen is known as the Day Moon, or the Lonely Moon. They appear as a faint but large purple circle in the sky during the day.
