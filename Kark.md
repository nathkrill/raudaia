# Kark

Kark is a fragrant herbal tea. The leaf of the plant grow mostly at oasis in the [[Alkhara Desert]].

Kark's flavour is hard to describe, but it makes the drinker feel cool and refreshed. It calms the senses, helping to reduce overwhelming feelings, hence it is often used to treat trauma or stress.
