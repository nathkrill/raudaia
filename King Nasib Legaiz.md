King Nasib Legaiz was [[King of the Lake]] in [[Legaiziripo]] at the time of [[The Founding]].

He is the fourth generation of Legaiz leaders. The family is the namesake of the state of [[Legaiziripo]]. He inherited the title from his father, after his elder brother [[Subhan Legaiz|Subhan]] chose to forfeit his inheritance and abscond to [[Council of Arleans|Arleans]].

As of 0PF, King Nasib is already growing old. It is expected that he may surrender the throne before too long, although this is mostly gossip and speculation. 
He has three children: two sons ([[Shaul Legaiz|Shaul]] and [[Kamal Legaiz|Kamal]]) and one daughter ([[Mariam Legaiz|Mariam]]). The eldest, [[Shaul Legaiz|Shaul]] is in line to take the throne.
