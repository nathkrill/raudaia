# Chapter One

Arlo was an orphan boy, who didn't remember his parents. He lived with a cruel old caretaker called [[Lucia]]. 
His childlike mins didn't quite understand who she came to be his carer, and he often wished his parents were alive. 

Now there was a time when the festival of [[The Alignment]] was approaching. This was when the moons would line up in the sky to mark the end of the year. There would be a city-wide celebration, with dancing and music and costume and food. Arlo longed to go out until the streets and see [[The Alignment]] and be part of the festival. 

"Lucia, please can I go! Just for a while to see the moons?"

"Of course not child." She snapped. "and don't ask again or you'll be sorry."

But Arlo was desperate to see [[The Alignment]], and he couldn't help but ask again once more on the day of the festival. 

"Stupid boy! I told you not to ask again!" Came the reply. With that, [[Lucia]] grabbed Arlo and threw him in the cellar beneath their sandstone house.

The cellar was a dark, windowless room. Arlo sat on the sandy floor and listened to the sounds above and outside of the city getting ready for the festival, weeping as he realised that this was his life now. He would never get to enjoy parties, or have friends, or see the world.

As time went on, Arlo got restless and began pacing around the small cellar. The light began to dim outside and the small sliver of light coming from the hatch at the top of the stone steps slowly faded. It was just before the light went completely that something strange happened. A thin beam of sunlight gleamed from the hatch and lit up a small spot on the opposite stone wall of the cellar. 

Arlo got up from the step he had been sitting on and went to inspect the wall. It was hard in the dark, but the beam of light was definitely highlighting something... A brick! Not just a plain old brick like the other large sandstone bricks of the cellar, but a small, slightly darker brick that protruded ever so slightly out from the rest of the wall. 

With a trembling hand Arlo pressed into the brick. It slowly slid inwards and clicked into place. There was a loud grating sound and a large portion of the wall suddenly shifted and swing inwards, with dust and sand being disturbed and thrown into the air. 

Arlo coughed the dust out of his lungs and carefully peering into the doorway that now stood in the wall. It faded away into a dark passage that sloped downwards and out of sight. 

Arlo took a deep breath and stepped into the passage. His small footsteps echoed down into the unknown depths ahead of him.
Before long, Arlo saw some light ahead. He came out of the tunnel into an octagonal room. A small shaft of evening light shines down from a sewer grate far above him. He stepped further into the light and looked around. 

The room had three new doorways with passages going forwards, right, and left. 
Arlo hesitated for a moment, before going left.
"That's the way to the sea." He thought. "If the tunnel comes out there I can have a good view of the moons."

He walked further into the gloom. It went pitch black around him before gradually coming out into the light. He blinked. In front of him was an identical chamber as before: octagonal shape, 3 doorways, light from above. He frowned and this time went right. Again he went into the gloom, then out... Into another identical chamber. He signed out of frustration and this time went straight on, again to another!
He didn't know how many times he went around this maze before throwing up his arms and sitting down in a huff. 

In the silence that followed he heard something. A faint sound of celebration and cheers... It was coming from the passage *behind* him! He picked himself up and ran along the passage, which began to climb as the light grew brighter. At the end there was another sandstone wall, this one with a small gap at its base, with the warm glow of sunset shining through it. 
Arlo got onto his hands and knees and crawled beneath. He came out into the comparably bright light, and stood.
He looked around and he could see around him the low homes and shops of the main square in the city. All around him were people, brightly dressed and cheering and dancing and clapping. 
He'd made it to the festival!
