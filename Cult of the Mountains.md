The Cult of the Mountains is the religion mostly held by the [[Kara]] people of [[Palerabi]]. It is a violent and ritualistic order that reveres great monstrous beasts that live in caves high up in the mountains of the [[Kara Valley]].

As with most cults, it is very hierarchical. Lower initiates and citizens will not ever meet their gods, but visit statues and totems erected in the towns and cities of the western valley. Higher priests and druids make ritualistic sacrifices at the mouths of the sacred caves, and deliver offerings of treasure and produce in order to appease their gods on behalf of the people.
There are some who like to worship with hedonistic behaviour, often holding great festivals of pleasure in the mountains.

The great beasts of the cult have little to do with each other, save that they are jealous of the valley and it's protection. They sometimes fight each other, but if the valley were threatened they might join forces. In ages long past they fought a war against the [[Nelharim]], which is what drove them into hiding. To this day they still hate the [[Nelharim]] and the [[Nelhahet]] people bitterly.

## [[Hinara]]

[[Hinara]] is the master of secrets, lies, and forbidden knowledge. She is a giant spider. She loves tangled webs of manipulation, and uses her children as spies to learn the many secrets of the world. Her worshippers hope that their sacrifice and offering will buy them a place in her plans and machinations, and grant them insight and access to her secrets.

## [[Ibawat]]

[[Ibawat]] holds the domain of death and the undead. Followers come to him to try to gain long life, or to resurrect their loved ones.  The blessings he grants are often hollow and cursed.
In his cave, he resides as an immense pile of bones, which he can form into many horrific shapes.

## [[Shagrig]]

The god of gluttony, flesh, and decay. His form is a mountainous being of tormented flesh, with many faces and limbs protruding from his decaying skin. He loves blood and violence, and will grant his followers the means to torture and maim their enemies.

## [[Qatu]]

[[Qatu]] is a great salamander. He loves the shadows, and craves treasure. His worshippers are often thieves and assassins, who bring him stolen treasures in return for the rewards that aid their stealth and infiltration. He is known to send out groups to recover lost artefacts and great hordes for him. He also craves the knowledge of [[Hinara]], who knows of secret vaults and lost treasures of old.
