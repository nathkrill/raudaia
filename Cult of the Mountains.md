The Cult of the Mountains is the religion mostly held by the [[Kara]] people of [[Palerabi]]. It is a violent and ritualistic order that reveres great monstrous beasts that live in caves high up in the mountains of the [[Kara Valley]].

As with most cults, it is very hierarchical. Lower initiates and citizens will not ever meet their gods, but visit statues and totems erected in the towns and cities of the western valley. Higher priests and druids make ritualistic sacrifices at the mouths of the sacred caves, and deliver offerings of treasure and produce in order to appease their gods on behalf of the people.
There are some who like to worship with hedonistic behaviour, often holding great festivals of pleasure in the mountains.

The great beasts of the cult have little to do with each other, save that they are jealous of the valley and it's protection. They sometimes fight each other, but if the valley were threatened they might join forces. In ages long past they fought a war against the [[Nelharim]], which is what drove them into hiding. To this day they still hate the [[Nelharim]] and the [[Nelhahet]] people bitterly.
