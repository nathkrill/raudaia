### Rafah

![Rafah](raffah.png)

Somewhere out of the deep [[Alkhara Desert]] came the Rafah. A nomadic people, they mostly seem content to roam the wilderness in small tribes.
What holds these tribes together is the worship of a single god, [[Falah]]. For them, [[Falah]] was revealed atop the single mountain in the middle of the desert.
Apart, they are insular and survivalist people. Together, they are a righteous force to be reckoned with.
