### Rafah

![Rafah](raffah.png)

Somewhere out of the deep [[Alkhara Desert]] came the Rafah. A nomadic people, they mostly seem content to roam the wilderness in small tribes, although there are small pockets of them who have settled in the north and west of the desert in towns.

What holds these tribes together is the worship of a single god, [[Falah]]. For them, [[Falah]] was revealed atop the single mountain in the middle of the desert.
Apart, they are insular and survivalist people. Together, they are a righteous force to be reckoned with.

## Culture

Outside of their religion, most of the Rafah customs are largely around survival in the desert. They hold special meanings to things like star patterns and winds, as they guide their travels in the harsh climate.

Once a year, the [[Rafah]] gather to celebrate [[Mazhur]], the arrival of the god [[Falah]].
