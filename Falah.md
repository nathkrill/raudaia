## Falah, The Unchanging

![Falah](falah.png)

Falah is the unitary God of the [[Rafah]] people. For them he is the one true god, and all other gods are false. 

Falah revealed himself to the [[Rafah]] atop the solitary mountain in the centre of the [[Alkhara Desert]]. Cloud, lightening, and fire gathered around the peak as he delivered to them his divine purpose for their people. After this, a large egg-like structure appeared.

Part of this was a promise to give over the land of Raudaia to the [[Rafah]], and for them to spread the worship of Falah across the globe. There are many [[Rafah]] who would stop at nothing to achieve this goal. 

Falah ministers to his followers through prophets and priests. As the singular god, he is believed to be the provider and creator of all things. 

Falah is mostly dismissed by other religions, except for some followers of the [[Nelharim]], who are suspicious that he might be an incarnation of the evil deity [[Vadox]].
