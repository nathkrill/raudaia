Hitching is the capital city of the [[Witnes Conglomerate]]. Located on the western ridge of the [[Witenspire Mountains]], it looks over the frozen lands below, with the twin peaks rising high behind it.

## Small But Influential

Hitching is by no means a big city. The harsh environment it is situated in means that it's not easy to live a comfortable life there. As such, only the most wealthy members of the [[Khar]] live here in well heated, mostly underground dwellings.

## Notable Locations

There is an archive run by the [[Council of the Mystics]] in the city.
