# Mahzur

Mahzur or "Arrival" is the [[Rafah]] festival of celebration to mark the day of the year that the god [[Falah]] manifested itself atop the mountain deep in the desert.

Due to the large egg that [[Falah]] supposedly resides in, the theme of the festival is largely egg-based. Colourful egg decorations are displayed and worn, and lots of egg-based cuisine is provided.

Most of the nomadic [[Rafah]] congregate at the foot of the mountain for the festival, but those who have chosen a more societal life instead travel to [[Alkhablah]] to celebrate.
