The gods that the Dwarves worship are more like demi-gods. They are champions of the their people who have unlocked sacred powers of the world in order to bless their subjects.
It is believed that in the [[Khar]] time of need, the champions are reincarnated.

The worship of the champions is not one of rites and rituals, but rather an oral tradition passed down. When the champions appear, they are treated like great leaders, and the people rally around them for whatever cause they may have.

Most of the champions have a gender associated with them, usually based on notable incarnations in the past, but they can be reincarnated in many forms.

Most other religions believe the Kharparet are real, but consider them more as demigods or blessed warriors than actual deities. 

## Mythology

The [[Kharparet]] mythology speaks of a vast being, known only as The Crafter. 
The Crafter created the cosmos out of the pure chaos that existed before, then divided their essence to form the world's within it. Raudaia is one such place. 
This belief holds the [[Kharparet]] as agents of The Crafter, who now embodies the virtues of the world represented by the [[Kharparet]]. When those virtues are fading, The Crafter reincarnates one or more of the [[Kharparet]] - or blesses an individual to mantle their power, in order to restore the virtues to the world.
