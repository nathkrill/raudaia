# Kolar Tarryst

Kolar Tarryst is one of the many corrupt noblemen of the city of [[Caustow]].

Formally a barrister, Kolar has successfully maintained "justice" for many of the rich citizens of [[Caustow]] that have found themselves in court. He does so with a cunning use of bribery and extortion techniques.

Kolar seized an unusual crate from the pirate ship [[Errant of Amak]]. This made him a prime target for many individuals, and [[The Order of Eye and Tooth]].
After breaking into Kolar's estate [[Faal Baelitae]] was able to steal the shipment which turned out to be a strange metal ore.
