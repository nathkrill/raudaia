# Azraq Crater

The Azraq Crater is a large crater in the south-west [[Alkhara Desert]]. It has created long ago by some kind of meteorite striking the sand and turning it into blue glass.
The blue glass is a mysterious material, used for jewellery and craft as well as being ground into a fine powder for use in magic.

## Mining

The mining operation is overseen traditionally by dwarves, but only the bravest [[Khar]] will come from the cold north to a hot place like this.
The mostly [[Rafah]] workers wear thick leather clothes to protect from the shards and sharp edges. A lot of them also have thick iron eye covers with sack over to protect their eyes from the glare.

## Culture

Closer to the centre, where the ground is a little more flat around the edge of the pit, there more of a residential area, with small huts and tents. Here there are families. Many of the people here wear jewellery made out of the blue glass. There are stands where they sell crafted pieces, or find dust powder ground out of the glass.
