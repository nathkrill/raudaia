# Lendis Suldusk 

Lendis Suldusk is a half-elven who runs a secret fight club in [[Khizdum]]. Her club formerly had a venue hidden in the city, but was destroyed by the [[Monster in the North]]. They now meet in a large tent deep in the refugee camp outside [[Khizdum]], which is where [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] was introduced to her and entered into a fight.

Lendis is a large woman and very jovial. Her appearance masks a love of violence and viciousness.
