# Dhamf

A Dhamf is a camel-like creature found in the [[Alkhara Desert]]. They often move as herds and are usually spotted around oasis.

When not drinking or resting at an oasis, they are hard to find because they move at great speeds through the desert. From a distance you might spot a moving dust cloud.

## Appearance

The look a lot like a camel, but have large, stony protrusions around their body. They also have large beaks and long tongues.

The Dhamf have a symbiotic relationship with the [[Neama]], who are often perched on their backs looking for insects and moss.
