# Maret

Race: Human
Age: Late 40s
Occupation: Scholar, Lore-Seeker, Accidental Trouble-Magnet
Affiliations: None officially, though he has definitely annoyed several academic circles and one or two minor spirits

## Outline
Maret is a wandering scholar, obsessed with the forgotten, the forbidden, and the mildly dangerous. He specializes in ancient ruins, magical anomalies, and “things people really shouldn’t dig up, but do anyway.”

He’s brilliant but eccentric, often talking to inanimate objects (including his travel companion “Ethelstone,” a rock).

Carries far too many scrolls, maps, and half-truths, most of which are cluttered, badly labeled, or possibly cursed.

Despite his bumbling and quirky nature, he is highly observant, possessing rare insight into magical phenomena, especially those tied to memory, fate, and lost elven magic.

He’s not a fighter, but has a surprisingly strong sense of when to run, duck, or hide under a sacred artifact.

## Notable Facts
Was researching ley-line intersections near the [[Ashgrove]] when he requested [[Amrathel]]’s escort.

Recognized the spiral vault as a memory-sealed prison, something almost mythic in origin.

Believes [[Windcutter]] is more than a weapon—a key or echo tied to ancient elven rituals of binding and forgetting.
