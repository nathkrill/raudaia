# Amrathel

[[amrathel.png]]

Elven exile, once a masterful fighter of his people, now cast out of his home, [[Alranzande]], for defending a stranger at the cost of an elf’s life. Bound by a sacred vow never to raise his blades against his kin again.

### A Message from the Past
Amrathel, living in solitude, is approached by [[Liora]], a former student of his old master [[Vaerith]]. She brings a scroll from the dying master, revealing a long-held secret: **[[Vaerith]] orchestrated the very incident that led to Amrathel’s exile**, hoping to protect something deeper—something buried beneath **[[Stoneveil Ridge]]**.

---

### A Ghost of the Past Returns
On his journey to the ridge, Amrathel is confronted by the very **stranger he once saved**—now altered with elven grafts and carrying a cursed blade. After a brutal skirmish, the stranger vanishes in a flare of violet light, leaving behind his sword: a **beacon**, not a weapon.

Amrathel rejects it.

---

### Trials Along the Way
Crossing the [[Vale of Hollow Roots]], Amrathel narrowly survives an ambush by **[[Shadowbound]]**—twisted creatures born of silence and shame—using sheer physical prowess to leap the ravine and cut the bridge, stranding his hunters below.

---

### The Tomb and the Reflection
At [[Stoneveil Ridge]], Amrathel finds a **sealed tomb** guarded by mysterious cultists. After defeating them in combat, one uses a cursed shard to **unlock the tomb**.

From within emerges something **impossible**—**Amrathel’s own reflection**, older, colder, forged by guilt and rage. A duel of identity nearly begins… until Amrathel invokes [[Vaerith]]’s final lesson:

> “Mercy will tip the blade.”

He forgives his echo.

But that act **awakens something worse**—a monstrous entity born of Amrathel’s own **inability to forgive himself**. He and his reflection fight side by side in a final battle, striking down the entity, but at great cost.

His reflection dies, willingly.

---

### Aftermath
Amrathel takes time to recover and reflect. He finds:

- **Vaerith’s Journal**, revealing painful truths.
    
- A **Twinned Serpent Ring**, echoing paths not taken.
    
- The **Shattered Echo Blade**, capable of rebirth.
