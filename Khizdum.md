# Khizdum

Khizdum is an independant city-state at the time of [[The Founding]]. It was originally formed of dwarves who were tired of the harsh working life under the [[Witnes Conglomerate]] and removed themselves from it's control. The consequences of this are that the [[Witnes Conglomerate]] largely ignore [[Khizdum]] and refuse to trade or offer aid to them.

## Leadership 

At the time of [[The Founding]], [[Khizdum]] is led by [[Kirad]]. Formerly a high-ranking foreman in the mines of [[Witnes Conglomerate|Witnes]], [[Kirad]] used his savings and influence over many of the miners to found [[Khizdum]] first as a base of operations, and eventually into the city that it now is.

## Events 

Around 16PF, an unknown monstrous creature was ravaging the populous north of the [[Witenspire Mountains]]. [[Khizdum]] organised a force made up of fighting folk from across the north and into the [[Emerald Coast]].

The creature attacked [[Khizdum]], and destroyed some of its walls and many dwellings, before being driven off.
