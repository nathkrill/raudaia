# Quentin McQuall

![Quentin](quentin.png)

Quentin is a goblin acrobat who grew up in [[The Circus]].
His mentor [[Fahnren]] left without warning, something that he never quite got over.

After [[The Circus]] was attacked in [[Leeyaz]], Quentin went north to the town of [[Issren]] where he got tangled up in a conflict between the townsfolk and the [[Bandits in the Tunnel]].
