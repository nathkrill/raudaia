## Effects & Features

**Deft Deceiver**
Spend a hope to take advantage on a deception or trick

**Enrapture**
Make a Spellcast Roll against a close target. On a success, you can temporarily keep their attention on you, narrowing their field of view and drowning out any sound but your voice. Once per short rest, you may also mark a Stress on a success to deal a Stress to the target.

**Rally**
Once per session, describe how you rally the party as they head into the fray, then give yourself and each of your allies a d6 Rally die. 
Anyone with a Rally die can spend it to roll it, adding the result to an action roll, reaction roll, or damage roll, or clearing Stress equal to the Rally die result. 
At the end of each session, all unspent Rally dice are cleared.
The Rally die you distribute increases to 1d8 at level 5.

**Troubadour**
Relaxing Song: Once per long rest, perform to heal allies by 1HP.

Epic Song: Once per long rest, perform to make an enemy vulnerable

Heartbreaking Song: Once per long rest, give 1 hope you and allies

**Goblin**
✅ **Danger Sense**: Once per short rest, mark a Stress to make an adversary reroll an attack against you or an ally within Very Close range of you.
**Surefooted**: You ignore disadvantage on Agility rolls.
