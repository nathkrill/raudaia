It is 16PF. The fledgling civilizations of [[Raudaia at The Founding|Raudaia]] are settling into this period of order and expansion. So far there have been no disputes and no wars (besides the usual skirmishes in the [[Kara Valley]]).

In the lush forests of the [[Umrion Valley]], life is simple and relaxed. The [[Gafranthel]] people keep themselves busy with fishing, crafting and trading. But sometimes, life calls for something unusual, something exciting. That is where [[The Circus]] comes in. 

[[Quentin McQuall]] has been travelling with the circus since at least [[The Founding]]. His childhood before the joy and colour of this troop of entertainers is something he puts in the depths of his mind. This is his family, his tribe, his people. 

Sure, there are some dark spots. The departure of his beloved mentor, [[Fahnren]], before an important performance has left its scars on him, leaving him to withdraw a little from the others. 

Now, they arrived at [[Leeyaz]], and begin to prepare for tomorrow's performances.
