As the sun sets, camp finishes being set up. [[The Circus]] is on the outskirts of town, as usual. It's not often that people like the performers are welcomed inside communities. 

As dusk falls and fires and lamps are lit, the armed guards of [[The Circus]] begin to make their rounds. 

[[Quentin McQuall]] finishes setting up his small tent near to some trees at the very edges of the camp and heads inwards towards the large bonfire that marks the centre of the troops living area. Sitting by the fire, large jug of ale in his hand sits [[Inma]].
[[Quentin McQuall|Quentin]] joins him and pulls out his own drink - a small flask of firebrand liquor. 

"Y'all setup lad?" asks [[Inma]]. Quentin nods and takes a sip. 
"What's the matter? You haven't been yourself since we left Pevia." Quentin sits silently, staring at the dancing flames. "Still thinking about [[Fahnren]]? That's understandable." He puts his hand on Quentin's arm. "But that's part of this life my boy. People come and go. We pick some up, drop others off. It ain't always straightforward neither."
Quentin nods slightly and takes another sip, still staring at the orange glow. 

A few minutes pass, and all of a sudden raised voices can be heard from across the camp. Quentin and Inma look at each other, then stand and walk hastily over to see what's happening. 
They see standing at the town-side entrance to the camp a group of armed guards.

Does Quentin recognise their attire?
Instinct check DC9: `dice: 1d12` hope + `dice: 1d12` fear + `= [[Quentin McQuall]].Instinct` = 18h

Are they from [[Gafranthel]]? Fate check likely
`dice: 1d%`29 = yes

Quentin sees immediately that these are guards from [[Leeyaz]], with the [[Gafranthel]] symbology on their coats. 

The guards are flanking a number of [[The Circus]] guards, who look beaten and worn. 
[[Bloola Steel]] is confronting the guards and is doing most of the shouting. 

"We've got a performance tomorrow! How do you expect us to prepare in peace without our security? We'll be killed in our sleep by monsters, ruffians, brutes!"

"The only ruffians about here, ma'am, are your people." Replies the leader of the guard. "Like I said already, we apprehended your guards shaking down innocent civilians of Leeyaz. We have no choice but to take them into custody." he waves his hands and the soldiers turn and begin to march away.

As they walk away, Bloola throws a dagger, it flies out of her hand and lands square in the back of one of the renegade circus guards! He falls to the ground, dead. 

The guards stop their marching and draw their weapons, a combination of short swords and crossbows. They look to their captain.

What does the captain do? Character Actions table 
`dice: 1d%`16 brave `dice: 1d%`97 vengeance

The captian draws his sword and nods, sending forward the soldiers. 

Quentin and Inma rush forwards as well, joining the circus folk trying to defend Bloola. 

[[Session 1 - Circus Encounter]]

Fleeing into the woods, Quentin hides in a deep thicket. 
The guards run in, taking his bait and going left. But on guard waits back, blocking the way back to camp.

Quentin slips through the trees to get back to camp

Finesse Roll
Hope `dice: 1d12`8 + Fear `dice:1d12`10 + `= [[Quentin McQuall]].finesse` = 19 with fear

Quentin males it back to camp unseen, but as he arrives he sees that there are now many guards walking the camp, rounding up the performers and pulling down tents.

Does Quentin see any guards who were at the fight?
Hope `dice: 1d12`5 + `dice: 1d12`fear 5 critical!
None of the guards are familiar, and so he confidently strides across the camp towards his tent, acting like he belongs. 

Presence check
Hope `dice: 1d12`1 + Fear `dice: 1d12`11 + `= [[Quentin McQuall]].presence` + `dice: 1d6`1 = 15

A few guards look my way, taking mental note of my appearance. One asks where I'm going but I wave him away arrogantly. I'm not stopped, but my appearance has been noted. 

I reach my tent and quickly pack down, collecting all my belongings. I pull the pack over my shoulder and hastily leave the circus camp.
