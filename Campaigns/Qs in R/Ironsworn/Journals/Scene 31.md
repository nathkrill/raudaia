[[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] spends a good few days recovering in [[Khizdum]]. He has a bed in the headquarters and frequently visits [[Lendis Suldusk]]'s ring. He doesn't do much more fighting but enjoys the drink and company. 

One particular evening he comes back to the hq to find [[Khola]] drinking alone, examining maps and plans. 

> "[[Khola]]! You're up late... And drinking alone. Do you want some company?"

```iron-vault-mechanics

    roll "Heart" action=6 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=5 vs2=3

She sighs and brushes the papers aside, falling back into her chair. 
>"Sure, I could use a break from that. How's things Quentin? You seem to be settling well here."

Quentin pulls up another chair and sits beside her.

>"Yes, lots of like-minded people here. Besides, I feel responsible for your city now...
He paused a moment. 
>"And of course there's you. I feel a connection building here. What do you think?"

`Does she like him? Slight no`

She turns and looks at him. 
>"You've done a lot for us Quentin. I appreciate you greatly. You're... A fantastic asset."

She looks away, ashamed. 

>"Of course. You have a lot on your mind. Hard to make attachments when the people you swore to protect are freezing and dying out there. I understand."

There is a moment of silence. 

>"Thank you Quentin. Goodnight."

She downs her drink and leaves.
