*Flashback to Quentin's time in [[Lendis Suldusk]]'s fight club*

Quentin has just finished a successful bout in the ring. He sits by the bar counting his rewards.

A figure approaches. They are a fairly athletic looking lizardfolk male. He has brown scales, which tint green at the ridges. His face has a lot of piercings in his lip, upper cheek and ear.

>"That was a good fffight. You handle yoursself well. Very graacceful."

He draws out his words, elongating them with whistles and hisses.

[[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Characters/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] turns to face him.

>"Thank you, you're too kind. What's your name?"

The lizardman's tongue flicks and licks his eyes as he extends a clawed hand.
>"I'm [[Gnawr]], it's niccce to meeet you ...Quentin."

His tone is very flat and emotionless. Quentin takes the claw and gives it a light shake.

>"Well thanks for the complement, but I'd best be off. Take care now."

Gnawr steps between Quentin and the door.

>"Jussst a moment of your time, ...please."

Quentin relaxes in his stool and swivels around to face him.
>"Okay, what is it that you want?"

[[Gnawr]] takes a stool next to Quentin. His tail curls and wraps around the legs.

>"I usssed to own a lot of ...land around here. Obvviously that is no ...longer the cassse."

Quentin is visibly impatient at the slow speech.

>"One sssuch place ...is a faaarm, due wessst of heere. It wasss ...ruined by the monssster abroad. I had to ...abandon it in a huuurry. I leffft behind a preciousss heirloom of mine.
>I woulddd go baack and ...retrieve it. But the plaaace is now overrun with ...daaanger.

Quentin interrupts him.

>"Let me guess... You want me to go out there and fight of whatever's infested your farm, and get the heirloom for you?"

[[Gnawr]] looks blankly at Quentin, licking his eyes once again.

>"That'sss ...right. You would be well ...rewarded. I ssstill have much of my wealth ssstored up in the ...city."

Quentin stands and pats [[Gnawr]] on the shoulder.

>"I'll think about it. I'll return here with your item if I make it out there.
