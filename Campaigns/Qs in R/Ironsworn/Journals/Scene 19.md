Scene: Quentin is introduced to the captain of the guard in Khizdum. 
Altered Scene: Quentin is sent into the city to find the captain of the guard

The guards continue to escort me on through the mess of tents and shelters towards the crumbled city gate.
We are just approaching part of the wall, when there is a loud clamour sounding from the camp behind us.
The guards turn and gaze over the camp to try to see what's going on.
>"Damn it! Let's go see what's going on now. You! [[Issren]] boy, head into town, follow the main street up to the triangle. On the right is our headquarters. Go inside and ask for [[Khola]]. Tell her [[Shiz]] sent you in. She'll hear your story."

The dwarf turns and begins jogging with the others back into the encampment. I am alone by the ruined gate.

I head into the city, picking my way through rubble and waste.
The wide city streets are empty and eerie. Any buildings left standing are boarded up. I catch a view of some people inside, but none it seems are brave enough to wander the streets.
I follow the road.
*Do I reach the triangle? Yes*

I arrive at an open area with three points. In the right-hand point is a squat stone building.
*Is it guarded? Exceptional yes*

There are two dwarf guards either side of the door, and two on the roof with bows. They see me coming and all ready their weapons. I roll my eyes.

>"Halt! State your business in the city."

> "My name is [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]]. I am here representing the town of [[Issren]]. I need to speak to [[Khola]]. [[Shiz]] let me in."

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)" {
    roll "Heart" action=6 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=5 vs2=9
}
```

 The reply comes back.
>"If [[Shiz]] let you in, then where is he?"

>"He had to leave me at the gate. There was some commotion within the camp. He assured me I would be let in."

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)" {
    roll "Heart" action=2 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=2 vs2=10
}
```

The guard shouting to me (on the roof) speaks to the guard at his side and one by the door.
>"You two, head to the gate. Make sure the city is secure and [[Shiz]] can handle whatever's happening out there."

He follows the archer off the roof and the archer and doorman run off down the street I came down.

I'm left alone with the other doorman for a minute.

I break the silence.
> "You're all very cautious around here at the moment. Something tells me this place isn't always such a cold welcome."

> "Yeah no kidding. You'd be on edge too if you'd been sacked by a monstrous creature that then disappeared. Who knows if it'll come back."

`Does he check the sky? No`

He glances past me and across the triangle to the other two streets, as if expecting some horror to come out suddenly.

`Do I have time to ask him what it is? No`

I'm just about to ask him what the monster is, when the guard from the roof arrives.
> "Come in, kiddo. [[Khola]] will see you now."

He leads me into the building. It appears to be some kind of training arena. There's sand on the floor and a roped off square in the center with four stone pillars in each corner. Practice dummies are in rows along the right and left walls.
The far wall from the entrance is lined with weapons and has some wooden tables and benches pushed up against it. Sitting leaning on the bench is a female dwarf with heavy plate armor.

>"You're the kid from [[Issren]]? Come over."

I nod at the guard and walk over.
> "Hello, my name's [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]]."

 I extend a hand.
`Does she shake? Yes`

She reluctantly grips my hand and does a quick up-down.

> "So, are you going to tell me why your cozy town decided they were too good for us northerners and left us to die?"

My jaw opens, shocked at her bluntness. I compose myself.

I condescend to her.
> "The situation in [[Issren]] is not as pleasant as you think, miss [[Khola]]."

 She frowns.
> "We recently underwent a coup of many of our town guards, led by an organisation of bandits from the nearby jungles. We were successful in retaking control, obviously, but the town is rebuilding. I'm afraid we don't have the resources to spare right now, no matter how dire the need."

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)" {
    roll "Heart" action=3 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=3 vs2=6
}
```

She stands up straight at that.
> "How dire the need?! Our people have been terrorized, slaughtered, and left destitute by this monster! The need is way beyond dire!"

She gestures wildly with her hands as she speaks. I put up my hands to calm her.
> "Now that I am here, I do regret the circumstances that prevented us from lending aid. It seems we underestimated the threat. I'd love to make it up to the people of [[Khizdum]] in some way. Perhaps we could set up a relief offering, or take in refugees?"

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)" {
    roll "Heart" action=6 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=1 vs2=6
}
```

[[Khola]] relaxes a little and sighs.
>"I'm sorry, I shouldn't take it out on you. You've clearly been through a lot as well. I will accept any kind of aid that [[Issren]] has to offer, as payment of the debt they owe us by breaking their promise. You may go home."

She turns back to her desk.

> "Can I ask something?" I say timidly.

> "Yes?"

> "The monster, what exactly is it?"

`Color, Spider-like`

[[Khola]] turns to face me, fear and dread in her eyes as she recalls what she saw.

> "It was big. Larger than two men tall. A bloated round body with many limbs coming out. Like a spider but more grotesque. It's colour changed, like it was blending into it's surroundings - except when we struck it or it struck us. Then the colours flashed like they were it's emotions: Anger, hate, glee... I've never seen anything like it. It tore through soldiers before they could strike. It barrelled through defences and buildings like they were sand. We fled and hid, eventually I think it got bored and wandered away. That's why we're on high alert. Who knows when it might come back..."

She trails off. I shudder.
> "That sounds awful. Which way did it go?"

> "West, to the other side of the valley. But even if it doesn't come back this way it's bound to start making it's way south. It came from the north originally - we heard reports of towns and villages falling, but we never expected it to take out a city, even a small one like [[Khizdum]]."

We both stop for a moment and stare into the distance, like we are both waiting for the creature to arrive any second.

I break the silence again.

> "Have you tried to find out anything about this monster? What it is? Where it came from?"

> "No. I thought about sending someone over to the [[Council of the Mystics|Mystics]] archive in [[Hitching]] but my surviving men are a bit short at the moment."

I perk up.
> "I could go! I only just made it here and I'd rather be useful nearby rather than go all the way back to [[Issren]]. Besides, you dwarves could use a little color and joy among you."

I flash her a grin and extend my arms letting the ribbons flutter.

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)" {
    roll "Heart" action=6 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=7 vs2=7
}
```

Her head shoots upright.
> "Would you? That would be perfect! Of course you can stay here and resupply however you need - anything you need is at your disposal."

I take her hand again.

> "It would be my pleasure, [[Khola]]."
