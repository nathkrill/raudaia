Scene: Quentin goes back to see Kater. 
Altered scene: she comes here. 

After a week or so, [[Kater]] comes into the [[Bumpy Shroom]]. 

"[[Kater]]! It's good to see you! How's the clearup at the castle going?"

"It's going well. We also chased down [[Erard Willow]] - he's locked away in the citadel for now."

"That's good news! And you've managed to rebuild the guard?"

"Mostly, although we will need to recruit some new members, perhaps from some of the other towns out in [[Emerald Coast|the coast]]."

I nod, and wait for her to continue. 

*Is she going to reward me?* No

"This town owes you a lot, [[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Characters/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]]. I owe you a lot. Normally this kind of debt would be payed in gold, but without a mayor I don't think it's proper to dip into the coffers like that."

I shrug, and carry on listening. 

"But you will always have a place here, [[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Characters/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]]. You won't be forgotten. Least of all by me."

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Forge a Bond](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/forge_a_bond)" {
    roll "Heart" action=2 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=4 vs2=3
    burn from=8 to=2
}
move "[Forge a Bond](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/forge_a_bond)" {
    roll "Heart" action=4 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=10 vs2=8
}

```

"Thank you, [[Kater]]. I appreciate it."

I raise my drink towards her, and guester to buy her one. She shakes her head. 

"There is a other reason I'm here, [[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Characters/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]]." She pauses. "I know you've done so much for us already, but I do need something from you. Remember I said about that creature ravaging the north? Well I promised that [[Issren]] would help. Obviously that's not going to happen anytime soon. I need to let them know we won't be coming. But I can't spare anymore soldiers at this time. So I was wondering: would you go for me?"

"I'd be glad to help." I reply. "But where exactly am I going?"

"It was [[Khizdum]] who sent out the call. It's an independent Dwarf town in the [[Witenspire Mountains]]. Apparently the [[Witnes Conglomerate]] refuse to support them so they're reaching out other neutral territories."

I nod. "I can make my way there. Any suggestions on a route?"

"You could head south by road, then pass through [[Gafranthel]] and use the trade roads north. Alternatively you can head west through the wilds. But that means going through the [[Starved Wastes]], which I wouldn't recommend."

"Noted. I'll head off in the morning, then."

"That's good news. I am continually grateful, [[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Characters/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]]."
