Expected scene: Quentin hands over the newspaper to the guard, then gets directions to begin searching the jungle for the robbers.
Scene check: 9. expected

[[Quentin McQuall|Quentin]] leaves the [[Issren#Bumpy Shroom Tavern|tavern]] and heads immediately back to the  forest road gate to find the gate guard. He hands over the newspaper.

"Here's your paper... I never got your name?"
"Name's [[Hugo]]. Thanks, friend."
"I'm Quentin. Say, do you know about the robbers out in the jungle - the one's that have been bothering [[Ka'Eek]] at the tavern?"

Does the guard know about them?
likely: 77 Yes

"Yeah I know that lot. Got some hidden way in and out of town - we've never been able to stop them getting in or out."
"Do you know where they make camp? I'm going to try to get rid of them for you."

Does the guard know where they are?
unlikely: 96 extreme no

"Not a clue. Could be in any direction out of here. Your best bet would be to find their way through town and work out from there."

"Good idea, thanks for the advice."

Quentin salutes the guard and heads out of the gate, working his way around the town walls looking for something that might give away a secret entrance.

He finds something - what is it?
*easy disadvantage*
Quentin spots a crack in the outside of the town wall. The crack is narrow, but goes deep into the ground. It looks like on the other side of the wall might be a larger opening.
He heads back inside the town and finds the spot - it's a raised bank which slopes towards the bottom of the wall. A large tree is growing at an angle from the slope to the wall. At the base, beneath the trunk is the crack in the wall.
"This tree must have been here for years" Quentin says to himself. "No-one must pay it any mind at all."
He peers into the dark hole. A narrow passage of earth and stone goes steeply down into darkness underground.
"This is more than just and entrance! It's a passage right down into their den!"
Quentin slides feet first between the tree trunk and the stone sides of the wall, landing softly in the tunnel. He descends onwards into the gloom.
