Expected Scene: Quentin enters a network of tunnels and begins searching for the bandit lair
Scene check: 10. expected

Quentin begins to make his way through the long, dark tunnel. It slopes ever downward, leading him who knows where.
*heal weapon*
He comes to a small cavern, where the tunnel opens outward and continues the other side.
A bowl-shaped pit is carved out of the ground. It's surface is blackened with soot and charred coals lie in the bottom. Next to this pit is a raised stone platform, about waist high. It is smooth and shows a very heavy beating. Next to it is a battered wooden bucket.
It is clear that this is some kind of makeshift smithy.
Quentin searches around the room for clues. It's clear he needs to keep going out the other side but we wants to know more about this place he is exploring.

Duality roll: instinct 2h + 2f + `= [[Quentin McQuall]].instinct` = 4 critical!

Amongst some piles of rubbish that's lying around, Quentin finds a tattered coat with a note in the pocket. It reads:
*"Behind the cracked brick, beyond the second torch, lies the path to our refuge. Only the wary shall find solace in the depths. - L"*

Startled to find something so direct, Quentin cannot believe his luck!
He pockets the note and heads onwards into the next tunnel.

*return friend*
The tunnels reach a splitting point, with one to the left, going sharply upwards, and one to the right, twisting back behind.
Without any clues to guide him here, Quentin randomly takes the left-hand tunnel.

*recruit success*
The tunnel twists up a while. As it does, a light begins to spill down from whatever lies at the top. Quentin slows down, and listens ahead.
instinct roll: `= [[Quentin McQuall]].instinct` + 7h + 11f = 18 with fear.
He hears a loud, rough voice echoing in a chamber ahead.

"Alright you lot, let's see what you're made of! Pair off and stand opposite your partner, at my signal you will wrestle until one of you yields."
There is the shuffling of feet, then the voice shouts "Begin!"

Quentin edges closer to try to see what's going on.
agility roll: `= [[Quentin McQuall]].agility` + 9h + 8f = 18

He sees 4 pairs of gruff looking individuals, wrestling on the ground, with a larger one pacing between them, barking advice on their form. Quentin assumes that these are some kind of bandit trainees. 
A number of tunnels split off from this chamber, but there's no way through without being spotted. Quentin decides to double back to the fork and take the right-hand tunnel instead. 

*reward depletion*
The tunnel goes to what looks like a long-abandoned store room. Dusty crates line the square chamber and a musty aroma hangs in the air. 
Quentin searches the room for anything useful, however unlikely. 
Instinct roll dc20 `= [[Quentin McQuall]].instinct` + 7h + 4h = 11
He doesn't find anything but spiders, so continues on through the next tunnel. 

The tunnel goes on, the darkness seeming to stretch on forever. 

After some time walking, the tunnel opens up to another cavern. This cavern is lined with a rough brick wall, and has various workbenches. I approach quietly.

Delve the Depths + shadow => weak hit

Reveal a Danger: Environmental Hazard

The room is empty, and appears to be a dead-end.
I examine the wall closely, remembering the note I found before.
Are there torches on the wall? Yes

I go left-to-right, finding the second torch. I look for a cracked brick.

Gather Information: Miss

There is no cracked brick to be found. As I scrabble along the wall, I hear footsteps coming down the passage.

I try to find a place to hide.

Face Danger: Strong Hit!

I duck under a desk close by the the right curve of the wall and hide.

A small group of 4 bandits come into the room.
Do I recognise them from the training room? Yes.

They file into the room, discussing their training session.
Do they open the secret door? Yes.

One of them finds the cracked brick I had been looking for and presses hard on it. A loud grating noise sounds through the chamber as a portion of the brick wall opens inward by a hinge.
The bandits go into the tunnel one-by-one.

I dive in behind them, trying to get into the door before it closes.

Face Danger: Strong hit

I slide into the doorway as it snaps shut on some kind of spring. I'm left in a dark tunnel sloping downward.

 I head down the tunnel, slowly and quietly.

Move: Delve the Depths

As I slowly creep along, suddenly there is a loud creaking and cracking. Dust and rocks begin to fall from the ceiling.

Is the collapse ahead? No.

I quickly creep back to the tunnel entrance, to find that it is well and truly blocked by a collapsed ceiling.

As I inspect the pile of rubble in the way, I hear voices as the bandits start coming back up the tunnel.

With nowhere to hide, I crouch down in the shadow and prepare to ambush them.

Secure Advantage: Weak hit
 
 As they come up the tunnel, I suddenly leap forward and lash out with a rope-blade.

Enter the Fray: Weak hit - Take initiative

Strike: Weak hit

My blade goes right into his eye, and he falls to the ground.
As I pull the ribbon to get the blade back, the others rush forward.
The first raises his sword. I slide beneath his legs.

Face Danger: +1 danger sense +1 agile => Strong Hit!

The sword comes down behind me and I slide and stand now between 2 of them.

I spin and slice 2 blades at once at each of them.

Strike: Weak hit.

They both go down, blood gushing from their necks. The final one charges at me.
I kick off the wall to get behind him.

Face Danger: +1 Agile +1 Danger Sense
Weak Hit.
He doesn't hit me, and I land behind him. He spins to face me before I can attack. We both go for each other together.

Clash: burn momentum for weak hit

We both take a blow, my dagger going into his chest and his sword striking my arm.

Turn the Tide (Strike): +1 Weak hit
My blade sinks into his other chest. He raises his arm to hack me away. I kick off his chest and backflip away.

Face Danger: +1 Agile: Weak hit

I land just infront of him. He comes at me again as I go to roll between his legs.

Face Danger: +1 Agile: Strong Hit!

I come up behind him and rush away to get out of his range.

Secure Advantage: Strong hit! (+1)

I turn back and fling both daggers at him as he begins to turn around.

Strike: +1 : Weak hit.

They both hit, but he keeps coming. I dodge around him again.

Face Danger: +1 Weak hit

I again avoid his attack, but he reaches out to grab me as I fly past.

Face Danger: +1 Strong Hit

He grabs air and stumbles forward. I spin and throw out the ribbon as a lasso.

Constrict: burn momentum for strong hit with match!

The lasso tightens around his neck. I pull tight around his throat and pull.

Strike: +2 Strong hit!
End the fight: Weak hit.

He falls down, his neck broken. I did not enjoy that. -1 spirit.

I rush on down the tunnel, not really worried about sneaking now.

Further down the tunnel I find what the bandits were running from. The colaspse had broken open gas pockets in the walls and a thick cloud of acrid air hits my lungs.

I run on, trying to hold my breath.

Face Danger: Strong hit

I hold my breath and run through it easily.
I keep going. The tunnel cramps up and I have to squeeze between small gaps in the tunnel.

Face Danger: +1 Weak hit.

I squeeze through the gaps. The pressing rock gives me a moment of panic.

I run down and come to a another chamber.

Is it occupied? No.

It's a chamber that has clearly gone through a lot of excavation. At the far end is a wooden doorway, with light coming from behind it. An exit!

Before I leave, I look for something to help me destroy this place.

Gather Information: Burn momentum for weak hit.

Oracle Hide Freedom

There's not much here, but this chamber has a lot of furniture and curtains that would definitely catch fire if I lit one.
I hurriedly try to light a fire.

Secure an Advantage: Weak hit

I set a small fire at the base of a curtain. The flames begin to rise quickly, then pass along the rail to the other curtain.

It's only then that I realise that the flames are around the door I need to leave by!
I throw a chair at the door to knock it open, then try to leap through the flames.

Face Danger +1 agile Miss
The chair doesn't knock the door open.
I throw out a ribbon to a beam on the ceiling and try to swing through the door,

Face Danger +1 agile +1 swing Weak hit.

I swing across the room and kick through the door, tumbling out in to a small ditch at the side of a low hill.
I get to my feet and rush off into the woods.
