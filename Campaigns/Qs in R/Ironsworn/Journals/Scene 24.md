Scene: Quentin and Kharb travel to Hitching
Interrupt scene: NPC Positive 

Before they leave the camp, [[Kharb]] grabs Quentin's arm and sits him down.

> "Before we go on, there are some things I should tell you... You know, now that we've almost died together."

Quentin listens quietly.

> "First of all - I'm not supposed to tell people this. But [[Khola]] and I... We're siblings. I think that's why she sent me out here, so I'm out of "harms way". But clearly that didn't work."

He goes quiet for a moment.

Quentin speaks up
> "I'm guessing she didn't want people to know. Is she embarrassed?"

> "Perhaps. I think I always told myself that it was so no-one targeted me to get to her. But I think you might be right. I'm not a very good guard and it might reflect poorly on her."

Quentin puts his hand on [[Kharb]]'s arm.
>"Then this is the chance to prove yourself to her. If we - if you finish this task then she'll see you as her brother, who she can be proud of."

>"Thank you, [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]]."
>"The other thing... When I was being chased by the monster, there was something I noticed... When I pulled away from it a bit, it couldn't seem to find me unless I made some noise or something. If I had to guess I think it doesn't see too well..."

Quentin gasps
>"So if you're up close or noisy it can see you, but far away and quiet it's blind to you? That's incredible! Well done [[Kharb]]!"

He pats [[Kharb]] hard on the shoulder.
>"See, you're already doing so well. When we return I'll make sure [[Khola]] knows how valuable you are."

[[Khola]] looks down, then off into the distance.
>"If we return..."
