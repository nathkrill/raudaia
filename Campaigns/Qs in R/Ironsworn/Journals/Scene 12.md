expected scene: rest at the tavern
altered scene: interrogate at the tavern

As we find our way through the streets, I tell [[Kater]] about what I've learned of the [[Bandits in the Tunnel|Bandit's]] influence in the town. She informs me that the soldiers who staged the coup have taken control of the town and imprisoned the mayor in the castle.

When we arrive at the tavern, [[Kater]] doesn't go in, but instead goes next door to talk to [[Uanan]].

_Does she learn anything useful? Yes: Divide Health_

[[Kater]] learns that 

"The plan was always to split the resources of the [[Bandits in the Tunnel|bandits]] so that their grip on the populous could be twofold.
Since the fall of the tunnel, the bandits within the guard are anxious about keeping control, which is why they have made a move against us, especially now that they may be sent to fight outside of [[Issren]]."

"They seem a lot more organised than your standard bandits." I observe. "I wonder if they're being directed by an outside source?"

"That could be true. If so, I don't think [[Uanan]] would know that. Perhaps cutting off who or whatever is behind them might make them scatter?"

"That will be hard with just the two of us. Perhaps we should try and gather some forces - quietly so we don't get ran out of town immediately."

"I can talk to some of the exiled guards. Not everyone was in the [[Bandits in the Tunnel|bandits]]' pocket. We can use the [[Bumpy Shroom|Shroom]] as a base of operations."

"That sounds good. Maybe I could get back inside the castle and find out who's behind all of this. I doubt that the guard who threatened you is the real leader."

[[Kater]] nods. "I doubt [[Minas]] is capable of this kind of organisation, but he does have the ear of the others. If you get an opportunity to take him down while you're there, I urge you to seize it."

"I will. At the moment, I'm pretty beat up. I'd like to take a day or two before making a play for the castle."
