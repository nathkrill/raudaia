[[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] has been captured by bandits. It is up to [[Khola]] to locate and rescue him, whilst also dealing with the bandits.

The bandits have sent a note to [[Kirad]], informing him of [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]]'s capture and exclaiming that they have demands of him.
[[Kirad]], knowing [[Khola]]'s connection to [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]], has tasked [[Khola]] with this. He can't risk [[Khizdum]] becoming more insecure by allowing bandits to manipulate and take control of them.

---

[[Kirad]] has just finished briefing [[Khola]]. They are inside his quarters in [[Khizdum]] castle. It's a fairly basic room, but some lavishments like an ornate rug and well-made furniture.

>"I understand, Lord [[Kirad]]. I'll make sure this gets resolved with the upmost haste."

[[Khola]] turns to leave.

>"Wait!"

Another voice pipes up. A small gnomish figure steps out from the shadows beside [[Kirad]]'s desk. It's [[Miki Rammedon]], [[Kirad]]'s close advisor.

>"I'm sure a woman of action such as yourself would love nothing more than to take your soldiers and storm the bandits. But please be clear captain, that your resources on this mission are severely dimished from your recent exploits. You did a good job dealing with that monster, but this is a far lesser task and we can't waste our city's security by rescuing an outsider from some mere bandits. Understood?"

[[Khola]] turns to him, fire in her gaze.

>"He's more than just an outsider - you know that! Quentin is the reason this place is now secure and safe from the [[Wahashka]]. Besides, there's more to these bandits than we know - especially if they were able to capture someone so capable.
>You can keep my soldiers away from me all you like, but let it be known that when this evolves into a city-wide crisis, __you__ will be responsible."

[[Khola]] storms out.
