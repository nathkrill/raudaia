Scene: [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] heads to see [[Khola]]

Quentin heads back across the camp towards the city walls. 

`does he find Kharb? No`

He comes to the gate and is greeted by some guards. 

`do they recognise him? Yes`

They wave Quentin in.
>"[[Khola]] will be glad to see you. She's in the HQ."

>"Thank you. Has [[Kharb]] come past?"

`has Kharb come past? No`

>"Haven't seen him. Wasn't he supposed to be with you?"

Quentin shrugs and heads into the city. 

It looks like things are slowly improving in [[Khizdum]]. Rubble has been cleared and there are some wooden supports and barricades reinforcing the walls. 

Quentin goes around to the headquarters, nodding at the guards by the entrance. 

`is Kharb here? Yes`

Quentin walks in to see [[Khola]] and [[Kharb]] talking. [[Kharb]] is very animated, but [[Khola]] relaxes and points to Quentin silently as he enters. 

[[Kharb]] turns around excitedly. 

>"Quentin! Oh you're okay! I was just trying to get [[Khola]] to come and find you."

Quentin laughs.
>"Of course I'm fine. Takes more than a few ruffians to bother me!"

[[Khola]] steps forwards. 
>"It's good to have you back Quentin. But I must see about getting some more perimeter guards looking out for that sort of trouble.
>Now, [[Kharb]] hasn't yet got to briefing me on your mission. What did you learn in [[Hitching]]?"

Quentin fills [[Khola]] in on the journey, their encounter with the creature and their findings in [[Hitching]] as well as the direction they last saw the monster going.
He pulls out the book. 
>"I haven't looked at this properly yet, but we should see what we can find. At least even if this book has nothing, what [[Kharb]] learned should prove invaluable."

They step over to Khola's desk and open the book. There are several creatures mentioned, and it takes a while to read through each one. But eventually they come to a familiar passage. 

[[Khola]] gasps as she reads. 
>"So, it's called a [[Wahashka]]...
>This is good stuff, boys, thank you for undertaking such a challenge."

She taps the page. 
>"I'll get the word around about this, and start mustering forces to track it down.
>In the meantime take a bit of a rest, both of you."

Quentin puts his hand on [[Kharb]]'s shoulder and leans into his ear. 
>"Wanna get into trouble? I've found a place where we can have a bit of fun."

[[Kharb]] gulps nervously. 
>"Um... Okay, but I'd rather avoid too much danger at this point."

Quentin laughs and leads him out the door.
