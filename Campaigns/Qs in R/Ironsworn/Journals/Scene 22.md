Scene: Arrival at hitching
interrupt scene: npc action, trap expectation

They are running across the snowy plain, hoping soon to see [[Hitching]] in the distance.
Suddenly the ground beneath them erupts! The monster leaps out, kicking up the snow in their faces.

They come to a halt, turn and run off to the left.

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Face Danger](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/face_danger)" {
    roll "Edge" action=5 adds=0 stat=3 vs1=4 vs2=10
}
```

They barely manage to get past the monster on the left, and keep bolting on. [[Kharb]] is screaming with fear.

The monster leaps over them and lands in front of them again.

This time, they turn and run in the opposite direction.

Quentin shouts:
> "Split up! Whoever it follows, the other should go straight to [[Hitching]], understand?"

[[Kharb]] nods and they divide and run off in opposite directions.

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)" {
    roll "Shadow" action=3 adds=0 stat=3 vs1=1 vs2=10
}
```

`Does it follow Quentin? No`

The monster digs into the snow with it's many horrific limbs and crawls speedily after [[Kharb]].
Quentin veers off and goes towards a small wood at the edge of the plain. After running through the trees, he finds a small ditch and dives into it, quietly listening for the sound of the monster.

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)" {
    roll "Shadow" action=2 adds=0 stat=3 vs1=6 vs2=4
}
move "[Gather Information](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/gather_information)" {
    roll "Wits" action=4 adds=0 stat=1 vs1=9 vs2=9
}

```

The wind rustles through the trees. The cold creeps up from the ground and Quentin can't help but shiver violently as the adrenaline fades. He hears nothing.

> "I can't wait here forever!"

He resolves himself and gets up, quickly but methodically rushing back through the trees but making sure he's out of site from any onlookers out on the plain.

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)" {
    roll "Shadow" action=5 adds=0 stat=3 vs1=4 vs2=6
}
```

He reaches the edge of the wood and peers out from behind a boundary tree.

`Is the monster in sight? Yes!`

He sees across the way to the north the monster, it's dark shape moving rapidly across the plain.

`Is it heading north? No`

It's heading south now, towards [[Hitching]]! At that speed, Quentin isn't going to get there before it does.

> "[[Hitching]] will have to wait. I need to see if [[Kharb]] is okay."

Quentin leaves the safety of the trees and goes north, in the direction [[Kharb]] had ran.
