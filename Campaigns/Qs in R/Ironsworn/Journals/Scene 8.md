Expected Scene : Quentin heads to the tavern. 
Interrupt scene. Move away from thread, agree suffering.

I'm just about to head to the [[Bumpy Shroom]], when two guards come out of the gate behind me. 
"Wait!" One calls. I stop and turn to face them. I grin.
"Did I leave something behind?" I say jovially. 
"We heard you got [[Enugar]] locked up." The other says, then pauses.

"[[Enugar]]? I assume he's that dirty guard."

"That's right. " They're not giving much away of their intentions. 

"Let me guess, he was a friend of yours? Well, perhaps you'd like to join him in chains? Leave me alone. "

They both stand straight up in shock. 

Are they friends with him? Yes

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)" {
    roll "Iron" action=5 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=5 vs2=1
}
```

They both look at each other for a moment, then their shoulders sag as they turn and head back inside the castle.

I head out into the streets.
