Scene: Castle exterior. Expected scene

[[Kater]] gathers her men in various houses the skirt the castle. 

I ask [[Kater]] if there's a back entrance at all into the castle.

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Gather Information](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/gather_information)" {
    roll "Heart" action=2 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=2 vs2=7
}
```

"There is, but it goes right into the barracks. It might be empty if our diversion works. If you don't fancy that, going over the wall's your best bet."

I thank her and clamber over the roofs to the rear of the castle and scope the rear entrance. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)" {
    roll "Shadow" action=4 adds=0 stat=3 vs1=2 vs2=1
}
```

I watch the entrance closely. It doesn't appear to be guarded. I wait for [[Kater]]'s attack to begin. 

Suddenly, I hear the cry. Soldiers pour out of the buildings and begin an assault on the gate. I wait a few moments to allow the barracks to empty then leap down and dash to the door. 

_is it locked? No_

The door opens with ease. I slip in. 
A stone stairway leads up to a candlelit room. I slowly creep up and peer in. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)" {
    roll "Shadow" action=5 adds=0 stat=3 vs1=2 vs2=3
}
```

_Is the room empty? Random event pc negative celebrate wound._

I step on a stone slab and suddenly there's a *click*. The step recedes into the floor. An arrow shoots out from a hole to the side. I leap forward up the stairs. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Face Danger](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/face_danger)" {
    add 1 "agile"
    roll "Edge" action=1 adds=1 stat=3 vs1=7 vs2=5
    burn from=9 to=2
}
```

The arrow clatters against the far wall as I roll into the chamber. It's a dimly lit mess chamber, with a couple of benches and a doused fire. 

_is the room empty? Random event move toward a thread. _

There are no guards in the room, but in a cage in the corner is a familiar mushroom figure crouched on the floor. 

"[[Ka'Eek]]!" I rush over to the cage. "Are you alright?"

He stirs in the cage, rolling over to greet me. 
 *Is he injured? No*

"[[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Characters/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]]? Oh you've come to get me? Thanks you, thank you!"

"One sec, let me get the lock."

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)" {
    roll "Edge" action=5 adds=0 stat=3 vs1=1 vs2=6
}
```



```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Aid Your Ally](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/aid_your_ally)"
```

I managed to jimmy the lock open, letting [[Ka'Eek]] out. 

"Quickly, down there and out. Head straight to the [[Bumpy Shroom]] and lock yourself in."

He nods. "Thank you, [[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Characters/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]]."
