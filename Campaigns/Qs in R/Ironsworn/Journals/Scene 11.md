expected scene: Quentin makes plans at the bumpy shroom.
interrupt scene: current context overthrow friend.

I'm just about to make my way up onto a roof and go back to the [[Bumpy Shroom|Shroom]], when I hear commotion back at the castle. I turn and look back towards the gates, which suddenly open.
Guards come running out. I rush against them and back into the courtyard.

I see chaos. There are guards fighting and wrestling each other.
One solider has a blade drawn against [[Kater]]'s neck and is standing off against another with a sword drawn.

I use the chaos to move in behind the guard threatening [[Kater]].

_Is he the guard who I spoke to at the gates before? Yes!_

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)" {
    roll "Shadow" action=4 adds=0 stat=3 vs1=9 vs2=7
}
```

Despite my attempts, he sees me and calls out. 
"You! Goblin scum! Don't move or I'll slit her throat."
I stop, my daggers at the ready.
"You don't wanna do this, man" I say. "Just let her go. We'll leave you to whatever's going on here."

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)" {
    roll "Heart" action=4 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=2 vs2=3
}
```

He looks at me with wide panicked eyes, then pushes [[Kater]] to the ground before running back into the citadel. I rush over to [[Kater]].

"You ok?"

"I'm fine, lets get out of here."

"What's going on?"

"Mutiny. Seems like a lot of my men were in league with the bandits and they didn't like your little clearout operation. They also weren't too keen on being sent to their deaths in the north."

"I was trying to tell you about that earlier." I explain. "No matter, let's get out of here."

We hurry to the castle gates

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Face Danger](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/face_danger)" {
    roll "Heart" action=2 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=4 vs2=1
}
move "[Endure Stress](datasworn:move:classic\/suffer\/endure_stress)" {
    roll "Heart" action=5 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=2 vs2=3
}

```

weaving our way between the chaos, dodging attacks and nearly getting crushed by the rush of soldiers. We eventually get out into the street.

"This way!" I cry. "I've got a place we can hold up in."

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)" {
    roll "Heart" action=5 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=3 vs2=8
}
```

"Are you sure?" the soldier accompanying us replies. "I'd rather take my chances out in the woods."

Despite mine and [[Kater]]'s plea, he heads off towards the town gate.

We break away and navigate the streets to the [[Bumpy Shroom]], barricading ourselves in.
