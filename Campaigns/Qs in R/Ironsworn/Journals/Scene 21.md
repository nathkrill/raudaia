Scene: Icy tunnel 
Interrupt Scene 

[[Kharb]] and I make our way through the dark tunnel. We can't see much but the icy chill of the frozen walls almost illuminates the space. 

The thin passage gets wider and the ceiling gets higher. As it opens up into a cave chamber something moves up ahead. 

A large dark shape looms in the cramped icy cavern. Long limbs protrude at seemingly random points on it bulbous form. A toothy maw hangs beneath the body drooling. This is the monster that's been terrorising the north. 

`does it see us? Yes`

A chattering hiss echoes in the cavern. The monster turns towards us and starts looming over us. 

Quentin loops his ribbons out, hoping to snare the monster's legs. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)" {
    add 1 "ribbons"
    roll "Edge" action=2 adds=1 stat=3 vs1=7 vs2=2
}
```

The ribbons catch around it's legs and it stumbles, unable to continue it's approach. 

> "Run!"

Quentin shouts. 
They turn and run out of the chamber and back into the passage. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Face Danger](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/face_danger)" {
    roll "Edge" action=4 adds=0 stat=3 vs1=1 vs2=1
}
```

The monster crashes through the narrow gap, causing ice and snow to fall between them. 
>"Look! We can climb up the rubble!"
says [[Kharb]].

Quentin grabs [[Kharb]] and pulls him up the rocks. They begin to climb out of the pit. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Face Danger](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/face_danger)" {
    roll "Iron" action=6 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=5 vs2=2
}
```

They reach the top and keep running off in the direction of [[Hitching]]. 

As they run, Quentin has a thought. 
> "[[Khola]] was sure that the monster went west, but not this far! It must be heading towards [[Hitching]]. We should warn them when we get there. "

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Reach Your Destination](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/reach_your_destination)" {
    progress-roll score=6 vs1=9 vs2=2
}
```
