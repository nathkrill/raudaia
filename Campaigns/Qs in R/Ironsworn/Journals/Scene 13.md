Expected Scene: Rest
Altered Scene: Rest and prepare

Quentin takes a day or two to rest.

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Sojourn](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/sojourn)" {
    roll "Heart" action=3 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=9 vs2=5
}
```

With the comings and goings of [[Kater]] and her contacts, Quentin is involved in more conversation than rest.
At the end of the second day, he approaches [[Kater]].

"I don't think I'm ready to move on with our plans just yet. Could I have another day?"

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)" {
    roll "Heart" action=5 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=9 vs2=9
}
```

"Absolutely not! I wish you'd told me this yesterday but our plans are in motion. We are ready to storm the castle. At the least, this will allow us to take back control while we figure out how deep this goes. While we do that you are going to infiltrate the citadel, release the mayor and maybe get some intel that we can act on quickly." She pauses and takes a drink.
"Any further delay is going to put my citizens in harms way. I'm sorry but it's now or never [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]]."

I sigh. "Fine. Let's hope this goes well."
