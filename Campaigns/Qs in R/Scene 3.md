Scene check: 9. expected

[[Quentin McQuall|Quentin]] leaves the [[Issren#Bumpy Shroom Tavern|tavern]] and heads immediately back to the  forest road gate to find the gate guard. He hands over the newspaper.

"Here's your paper... I never got your name?"
"Name's [[Hugo]]. Thanks, friend."
"I'm Quentin. Say, do you know about the robbers out in the jungle - the one's that have been bothering [[Ka'Eek]] at the tavern?"

Does the guard know about them?
likely: 77 Yes

"Yeah I know that lot. Got some hidden way in and out of town - we've never been able to stop them getting in or out."
"Do you know where they make camp? I'm going to try to get rid of them for you."

Does the guard know where they are?
unlikely: 96 extreme no

"Not a clue. Could be in any direction out of here. Your best bet would be to find their way through town and work out from there."

"Good idea, thanks for the advice."

Quentin salutes the guard and heads out of the gate, working his way around the town walls looking for something that might give away a secret entrance.
