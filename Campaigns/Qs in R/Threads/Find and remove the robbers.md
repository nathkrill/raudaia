[[Ka'Eek]] wants [[Quentin McQuall]] to get rid of the robbers in the jungle outside  [[Issren]].
It doesn't matter how, but Quentin should find a way to prove his deeds.
Following the advice of a guard, Quentin finds a passageway below the town wall.
After Quentin dealt with the bandits, [[Ka'Eek]] has been captured by corrupt guards. Quentin must find him.
The guards under the employ of the [[Bandits in the Tunnel]] have staged a coup and taken control of [[Issren]].
[[Kater]] and I organised an attack on the citadel. She would lead the remaining faithful guard, while I would sneak in the back. 
The attack was successful and I managed to kill the coup leader, [[Enugar]] as well as rescue [[Ka'Eek]].
