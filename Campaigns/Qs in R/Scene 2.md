scene check: 3 - altered scene - 5: Remove an object  -combine completion

Quentin doesn't travel up the river, instead he heads downstream to the coastal jungles of the [[Emerald Coast]].

What does Quentin find on his journey?
arrive nature

Quentin moves his way through the dense forest, the sound of the rushing water beside him guides him every eastward. He doesn't know where he is going, but he knows he needs to get away from [[Gafranthel]]. For all he knows there could be wanted posters for him all over the [[Umrion Valley]].

After the first day's journey he arrives at a large grove, with a small pool and grassy mounds. The sun sinks behind the cover of the trees and the air grows still. Before breaking the cover of the treeline he looks around the grove for signs of danger.

Instinct roll DC11: 8 with hope.

He sees nothing, any slowly steps out under the evening sky.
He takes a rest here, sleeping deeply through the night, then  wakes early and begins repairing his armour.

He then shoulders his pack and sets off once again into the trees.

Does he encounter anything along the way?

Instinct roll DC11: 22 + 0 with hope - yes, something good.
What is the nature of what he finds? block environment.
How is it good?  refuse expectation

Quentin comes along to a large wooden wall, stretching out across the wood. The stream continues through a small iron grate in the foot of the wall. A small gate marks the end of the road into this settlement.   

 A lone guard stands by the gate, clearly bored and tired. Quentin approaches the guard.
"May I come by?"
The guard is startled. He had began to doze off and clearly didn't expect to see anybody passing through today.
"I'm sorry. I'm under orders to not let anybody by, no matter their business."
"I'm just passing through, I won't do any harm - surely you could make an exception just this once?"

presence roll: 17 + `= [[Quentin McQuall]].presence` = 19 with fear.

"What's in it for me?" asks the guard.
"Well I don't have any money, but I could offer you a favour... Can I bring you anything from inside? A drink, some food?"

What does the guard want? continue news

"Well, it's pretty boring out here - you could bring me today's paper. I need something to read or I'll die of boredom!"
"I'll get you your paper, thank you, kind sir."

The guard steps aside and opens the gate cautiously, making sure that no-one sees his infraction.
I slip through and head on in. Before I disappear, I quickly ask the guard:
"What is this place, by the way?"
"You've reached [[Issren]], the last stronghold before the wild." He replies. "Be careful, it's not the most civilized of places". He chuckles.

Quentin walks through the damp, muddy streets of [[Issren]], firstly looking for a newspaper seller.

He is not able to find anything, and the rain begins to fall, forcing him to enter into one of the rugged taverns that line the streets.
It is not a welcoming environment. Hooded faces and sneering grins flash his way as he settles in a small wooden chair close to the door.
He doesn't stand out too much, however, as there are a few who look like road-worn travellers. Most folks there are what most would consider "outcasts" and so Quentin feels right at home.

Does anyone pay him attention?
likely - 72, yes

"You there, gobby. You gonna take a drink?" calls the bulbous Fungril from behind the bar.
Quentin nods - "Whisky, just a cup for now". He tries to blend his voice to match the vibe of the room.

Presence roll: 11 + `= [[Quentin McQuall]].presence` = 13 with hope.

The guy pours the drink, and has a younger Fungril female bring the cup over. Quentin hands her some coins.

He drinks in silence, casually glancing around the room.

Does anything catch his attention?
50/50 - Yes - lure,distraction

Suddenly, two ruffians who had been muttering in the corner stand up and walk over to his table. They begin shouting in his face and grabbing at his arms! It's unintelligible and Quentin doesn't know what to do.
"I don't know what you're saying! Is there something I can help you with?"
One goes in for a slap.
"Hey!" The barman calls out and steps around, coming over to pull the ruffians off. "There'll be no harassing of my paying customers! Get out, both of you!" He tosses them both towards the door and they scurry out. 
As they leave, a dark shadow flashes out from behind the bar and a tiny faerie flies after them, carrying a sack.
"Hey! My coin!" the bartender rushes out the door, followed closely by his maid. They stand out in the street, but there's no sign of the gang.
They come back inside, muttering "third time this month... damned hobos..." as they rsume their position behind the bar.

Quentin stands and heads up to them. He puts some coins down on the bar. "Thanks for stepping in, sorry about your cash."
"Sn'ot your fault, it's happened before."
"Why let them back in?" Quentin asks.
"It's different group each time, but they're part of the same gang. Group of robberes that camp somewhere out in the jungle. We've never been able to find them but that's why security is so tight thsees days." He looks at Quentin. "Though seems fairly lax to me, since you got in."
"I'm sorry..." Quentin looks at his feet. "Although, perhaps we can help each other. I need somewhere to board for a while, and you clearly have a problem in this town. Perhaps I could look into it for you - in exchange for a room for a while?"
"You think you could scare em off?" Laughs the Fungril. "You're welcome to try. Most can't even find out where they're hiding."
"I'll give it a try" says Quentin firmly.
"Alright, it's a deal. One room for as long as you need it, if you can bring me proof that they won't bother us again. What's your name by the way?"
"I'm Quentin, what's yours?"
"Names[[ Ka'Eek]]. Welcome to the [[Issren#Bumpy Shroom Tavern|Bumpy Shroom]] tavern - named it after myself of course."
"Pleasure doing business, Ke'Eek. I'll be off now - see you soon!"
Quentin heads to the door then doubles back - "I don't suppose you have a newspaper to hand? I owe someone a good read."

Does he have a newspaper?
likely - yes

"Here - I'm done with it." One of the patrons, a dark looking dwarf, tosses the rolled up sheet Quentin's way.
"Thank you kindly". Quentin leaves.
