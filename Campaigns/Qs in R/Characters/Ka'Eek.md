Ka'Eek is a Fingril bartender at the [[Bumpy Shroom]] in [[Issren]].

Ka'Eek was being targeted by robbers who lived in the jungles, and [[Quentin McQuall]] agreed to help him out in return for a free room at the tavern.

After [[Campaigns/Qs in R/Ironsworn/Characters/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] took out the [[Bandits in the Tunnel]], they targeted [[Ka'Eek]] and held him captive in the [[Issren]] citadel. Quentin sought him out and rescued him.
