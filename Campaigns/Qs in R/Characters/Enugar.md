Enugar is a town guard of [[Issren]]. He was secretly in the employ of the [[Bandits in the Tunnel]], until [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin McQuall]] killed them off and had him arrested. 

Two of Enugar's friends attempted to threaten [[Campaigns/Qs in R/PCs/Quentin McQuall|Quentin]], altering him to potential further corruption within the guard.
