Expected Scene: Quentin enters a network of tunnels and begins searching for the bandit lair
Scene check: 10. expected

Quentin begins to make his way through the long, dark tunnel. It slopes ever downward, leading him who knows where.
*heal weapon*
He comes to a small cavern, where the tunnel opens outward and continues the other side.
A bowl-shaped pit is carved out of the ground. It's surface is blackened with soot and charred coals lie in the bottom. Next to this pit is a raised stone platform, about waist high. It is smooth and shows a very heavy beating. Next to it is a battered wooden bucket.
It is clear that this is some kind of makeshift smithy.
Quentin searches around the room for clues. It's clear he needs to keep going out the other side but we wants to know more about this place he is exploring.

Duality roll: instinct 2h + 2f + `= [[Quentin McQuall]].instinct` = 4 critical!

Amongst some piles of rubbish that's lying around, Quentin finds a tattered coat with a note in the pocket. It reads:
*"Behind the cracked brick, beyond the second torch, lies the path to our refuge. Only the wary shall find solace in the depths. - L"*

Startled to find something so direct, Quentin cannot believe his luck!
He pockets the note and heads onwards into the next tunnel.

*return friend*
The tunnels reach a splitting point, with one to the left, going sharply upwards, and one to the right, twisting back behind.
Without any clues to guide him here, Quentin randomly takes the left-hand tunnel.

*recruit success*
The tunnel twists up a while. As it does, a light begins to spill down from whatever lies at the top. Quentin slows down, and listens ahead.
instinct roll: `= [[Quentin McQuall]].instinct` + 7h + 11f = 18 with fear.
He hears a loud, rough voice echoing in a chamber ahead.

"Alright you lot, let's see what you're made of! Pair off and stand opposite your partner, at my signal you will wrestle until one of you yields."
There is the shuffling of feet, then the voice shouts "Begin!"

Quentin edges closer to try to see what's going on.
agility roll: `= [[Quentin McQuall]].agility` + 9h + 8f = 18
