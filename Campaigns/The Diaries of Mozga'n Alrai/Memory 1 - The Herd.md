## Experience 1

I take over the [[Sheep Herd]] from my father, [[Havnal Alrai]], since he is becoming too ill to keep up with the wandering sheep.

## Experience 2 -476PF

A new shepherd, [[Peter Galyt]] comes to the pastures where I once worked. I threaten him into bringing me sheep to feed on.

## Experience 3 -473PF

[[Peter Galyt]] confronts me about extra sheep being found, killed in the wastes. I insist it is not me.
I soon discover another vampire, [[Melmet Friga]] living in a cave and preying on errant sheep. I learn that he was turned by [[Jonah Romone]] and convince him that [[Jonah Romone]] has gone north and if he wishes to be free of his curse all he needs to do is kill [[Jonah Romone]].
