## Experience 1 -190PF

A wizard in town who had moved into our old home found the diary of [[Finai Habren]]. In return for access to our old home and dungeon (he will remain resident there for tax purposes), [[Camzah Indebok]] wants to sample us in order to determine the potential magical source of our immortality.

## Experience 2 -180PF

My experience in creating drugs and poisons allows [[Camzah Indebok]] to climb the social ladder and provide opportunities for all of us. He keeps my diary as a means to preserve the recipes we concoct.
