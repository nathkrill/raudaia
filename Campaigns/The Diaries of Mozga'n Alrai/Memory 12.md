# Experience 1 -174PF

In the four years after her escape, [[Freida Galyt]], now a broken and manic character, has devoted herself to [[Ibawat]]. She now commands an undead army which is marching on [[Wineven]].

## Experience 2 -174PF

I begin the construction of defences around [[Wineven]], much to the confusion of my peers. I make use of modern materials such as iron and glass.

## Experience 3 -172PF

My masterpiece is complete. A beautiful cathedral of wrought iron and stained glass in support of the divine enemies of [[Ibawat]].
I never step foot in such a holy place, but clerics and pilgrims come and make this town a holy place.
