## Experience 1 -445PF

A drought causes [[Dhanahraf]] to be abandoned. I am forced to migrate west and find victims in unwary travellers on the road.

## Experience 2 -445PF

I stalk a shepherd leading his flock over the desert hills. As I ambush him I realise it's [[Finai Habren]]! His tumble off the cliff didn't kill him but his walk is all crooked. He remembers me and asks that I provide protection as he migrates west as well. In return he will allow me to use him as a thrall.

## Experience 3 -445PF

As we reach civilisation, [[Finai Habren]] warns me that my name is known throughout the land and a price has been put on my head. I change my name to [[Morgan Albry]].
