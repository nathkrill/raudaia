## Experience 1 -50PF

Many of the nomads are beginning to head north into the [[Kara Valley]] as cities start to form there.
They pass through for supplies. I offer my houses as rooms to stay, and take advantage of the weary travellers.

## Experience 2 -46PF

An important figure amongst the nomads dies in my inn (oops!).
I stage an "investigation" and the landlord [[Galen Morrowmorn]] was discovered to have incriminating evidence in his possession. He was executed while me and [[Galass Habren]] enjoyed one of our many long sessions of passion.

## Experience 3 -45PF

Obsessed with my long lost knife, I melt down my collections of weapons and use them to create replicas. None are right, but I begin selling them on to travellers as protection.
