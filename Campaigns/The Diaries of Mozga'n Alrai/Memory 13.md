## Experience 1 -160PF

The slave trade reaches [[Wineven]]. Delighted that such things are now commonplace, I stop paying my service staff and guards the paultry sums I was before and keep them in indentured servitude.

## Experience 2 -158PF

As the town expands, I am consulted by many on architectural and social development. I often grow impatient with "contributing to society" and my designs are sloppy, prone to damage in storms. There have been a few disasters and many of my buildings have been abandoned, all except the cathedral.

## Experience 3 -154PF

As my work dries up, I am forced to empty out the dungeon. There happen to be some priceless artefacts in there! Art pieces and such from ages past.
I trade these for modern armaments and begin forming a milita.
