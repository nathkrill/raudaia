# Experience 1 -479PF

One night, after returning to ~~[[Abwahtar]]~~ and securing the [[Sheep Herd]], I visit the tavern. Unusually I am not with my friend [[Finai Habren]].

At the bar, an immensely beautiful woman in dark, revealing robes sits by me. She plies me with drinks and leads me stumbling to a nearby room where she ravages me.
In the throws of our pleasure, she leans down and I feel a prick just above my collarbone.

They day after I am feverish and things are foggy. I stumble home and collapse beside the bed of my ~~father~~.
I am plagued with strange nightmares of dark and shadow, accompanied by the sexual passions of the night before.
I awake to find myself covered in blood. On the bed lies the ravaged corpse of my ~~father~~.
