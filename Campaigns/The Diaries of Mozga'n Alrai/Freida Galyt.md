# Freida Galyt

[[Freida Galyt]] is the descendant of [[Peter Galyt]].
Ashamed by the family tales of her father's service towards [[Mozga'n Alrai]], she became a vampire hunter and followed his trail west to [[Wineven]]. There she was captured by him, now under the name of [[Morgan Albry]].

After escaping from [[Morgan Albry]], [[Freida Galyt]] became mad due to her decade of captivity. She fled into the mountains of the [[Kara Valley]] and found herself in the service of [[Ibawat]]. She took on the form of a lich, commanding an army of undead and bent on revenge towards [[Morgan Albry]].
