# Experience 1
As a teen, I first see [[Galass Habren]] changing through a crack in the curtain. Her body enraptures me and I can rarely think of anything else when I am alone.

# Experience 2 - 472PF

I am discovered spying on [[Galass Habren]] from afar and chased out of town. The next day, [[Isvan Mirrorwaste]] arrives in town and begins the hunt for me. I ambush him as he inspects my [[stone hut]] and feast on his flesh. His remains sustain me for quite some time, until I deposit his skeleton out in the desert.

[[Finai Habren]] hears about my spying on his sister and betrays me. My [[stone hut]] is destroyed and watches are put about the region. I manage to avoid the raid but end up confronting [[Finai Habren]] at a clifftop. Is the struggle he falls to his death.
