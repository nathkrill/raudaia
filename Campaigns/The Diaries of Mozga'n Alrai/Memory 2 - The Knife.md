## Experience 1
[[Finai Habren]] and I find a cave with a wealth of flint. We each take a shard and carve stone knives out of them. I treasure my [[Stone Knife]].

## Experience 2 -478PF
In the months that follow my curse and the death of my father, [[Finai Habren]] begins to get suspicious. I reveal to him my scar and explain what happened (leaving out the death of my father). He helps me feed my bloodlust on the sheep we herd by "losing" them in a [[stone hut]] out in the desert.

## Experience 3 -477PF
I live in the [[stone hut]], ravaged by boodthirsty hunger. My boyish face is a withered and sorrowful sight.
