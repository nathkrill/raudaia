Scene: Early Morning, wilderness

The group continue on until the first light of the day, at which point [[Snake]] finds them a safe place to camp.

They sit for a moment and take stock of their injuries. [[Greeba]] has a bad blade wound in her side, and [[Rat Scratch]] has scratches on his face from [[Snake]]'s miss.

> "I'm sorry, friend" [[Snake]] exclaims, gently patting [[Rat Scratch]]'s head. "Let's rest and heal up. We could all do with a rest. Are you sure you're up to the watch, [[Rat Scratch|Rat]]?"

[[Rat Scratch]] chirps affirmatively and begins his usual ritual of scratching in the ground around them. The others set up their beds and quickly fall asleep.

It is just after noon when the wake up, and quickly prepare to continue their journey south.
