Scene: [[Hayfield]] entrance

[[Snake]] and [[Rat Scratch]] enter [[Hayfield]] by the north road. They head into the town in search of the trader's hall, following [[Mathari]]'s advice.

It takes a while, as many of the residents do not engage well, but someone eventually gives them decent directions and they end up outside the trader's hall.

It is a three-storey building with a corner tower. [[Snake]] and [[Rat Scratch]] enter into a small hallway. There are a few casual traders with small benches of wares, and a large desk at the left-hand side.
[[Snake]] approaches the large desk, where there is a [[Kara]] clerk writing notes.

> "Excuse me, I don't suppose you could point me in the direction of [[Kiyan]]. I've been sent to deal with him."

The clerk looks up.

> "What do you think I look like? A tour guide? Find him yourself."

He waves [[Snake]] away.

[[Snake]]  and [[Rat Scratch]] turn and begin moving through the hall, asking for [[Kiyan]]. No-one seems to be wiling to help them out, so [[Snake]] goes to head upstairs.

The spiral stairway is in a corridor to the side of the hall. A cloaked man with a headscarf stands in the doorway with a sword at his belt.

> "Do you have an appointment?" he asks.

> "Yes, we are here to see [[Kiyan]]." says [[Snake]].

The guard eyes them up. Then he turns and unlocks the door.

> "Wait here." He says. "I will confirm this with [[Kiyan]]."

He goes through the door and locks it behind him. [[Snake]] and [[Rat Scratch]] wait patiently.

The guard returns and unlocks the door.

> "You may go and speak with [[Kiyan]], back room on the next floor."

> "My thanks" [[Snake]] bows his head and they enter through the door. It is locked behind them.

They enter the corridor and go into the spiral staircase. On the next floor they come out onto a large room with shelves and stacks of ledgers and documents. Another door goes to a corridor which runs to the back of the building.
They follow it and come to a back room, with a couple of small desks and stools around them.
A [[Kara]] man sits at this desk also, with a small pointed beard and close cut hair.

> "You are the two? Come, take a seat."

[[Snake]] sits at a stool, which [[Rat Scratch]] ignores the man and wanders around the room, inspecting it. He doesn't spot anything of any interest.

[[Kiyan]] puts his elbows on the desk and leans into his hands.

> "So, what can I do for you my friend?"

[[Snake]] smiles at him.

> "We were told you were a trader who could get us some provisions for a journey across the desert. There are four in our party and we are in need of a resupply."

> "You were told? By who?" The man smiles widely.

> "A wizard named [[Mathari]]. Do you know him?"

> "I can't say that I do... But any recommendations are welcome! I can certainly help you out!"

He stands and turns to a cabinet behind him. He rummages through some paperwork before returning to the desk.

> "I have 5 days worth of good supplies - nice dried meat and fruits and some wines. Or, I can offer you 8 days of not so good supplies: [[Goodberries]] if you are familiar.

> "Yes, I know these." says [[Snake]]. "What is the cost of these?"

> "1 gold for either." comes the reply. "I cannot give you both because then I would be out of stock, so please choose one."

[[Snake]] thinks for a moment, scratching his chin absent-mindedly. He turns to [[Rat Scratch]].

> "I think we will be able to stop around halfway, so let's go for the nicer food. I'm sure [[Temitope]] will appreciate that at least." He turns back to [[Kiyan]]. "The 5 days worth, thank you."

> "Excellent choice! Here."

[[Kiyan]] scribbles on a piece of paper and hands it to them. [[Snake]] gives over the gold coin.

> "Take this down to the basement and they will fetch you items."

He stops and picks up another ledger.

> "I have some other things you might be interested in if you are travelling. Enchanted items and weapons. You want to take a look?"

> "We are not the most wealthy travellers, but we will have a look." Says [[Snake]].

There are some wonderful things in there, but nothing that [[Snake]] nor his companions can afford. He gives the ledger back.

> "We will be on our way. Thank you for your provision."

> "Thank you for your custom!" says [[Kiyan]] "Take care!".

[[Snake]] and [[Rat Scratch]] go back down the spiral stair, then down the corridor and into a new room. This was a stone floored room, half kitchen, half storeroom, with an open hatch leading down to a basement.

They go down to find a dark stone room split in two by long, tall shelves. The walls and shelves are piled high with crates, chests, and small carts full of goods.

A muscular elven man sits on a stool, chewing on some bread.

> "Can I help you?" he asks as they come down the steps.

> "Yes, we have this." [[Snake]] hands him the ticket.

He looks at it, then goes around to the far end of the room and begins rummaging in a sack. He fills a smaller sack with some items, then goes to a barrel and collects some items there too.
After repeating this, he comes back with the sack.

> "Here are your supplies." He says gruffly. "You may go now."

[[Snake]] nods his head at the man and goes back up. Him and [[Rat Scratch]] leave the [[Hayfield#Trader's Hall|Trader's Hall]] and make their way back to the edge of town.
