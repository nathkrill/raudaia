Scene: outside the nest, dusk
Altered Scene: Night

The group travel on for a few more hours, as sunset turns to dusk and dusk turns to night.
They are searching around for anything that would indicate the presence of [[The Order of Eye and Tooth]].

They walk on into the night, until [[Greeba]] points out a dark sandstone tower cresting out from a small thicket of dried thorns. A small lantern glows by it's entrance.
[[Temitope]] points out some of the markings around the door frame, confirming they are the symbols belonging to [[The Order of Eye and Tooth]].

They hang back, and crouch down in the thickets.

> "What's our plan?" whispers [[Temitope]].

[[Snake]] scratches his head.

> "You were right before - we can't just ask for our item back... I think we need to steal it back."

> "You're kidding, right? Steal from the master thieves?" retorts [[Greeba]].

> "It's our only option, really." [[Snake]] shrugs, "Could be easy, who would expect it? We have the cover of night, and it's so remote I doubt they have much security."

The all agree, and make their way to the side of the tower away from the door.
There is a small window in the curved edge of the tower, clearly where a spiral stairway must be.

> "That window is only small enough for [[Rat Scratch|Rat]]" points out [[Temitope]]. "Why doesn't he go in and see if he can open the door for us."

[[Rat Scratch]] nods and hastily begins climbing up to the window.

> "Hold on!" [[Snake]] stops him. "We need to decide what to do if we come across any obstacles. Do we really want to be killing members of [[The Order of Eye and Tooth]]?"

> "Fine by me" says [[Greeba]].

> "Anything to get the package back" agrees [[Temitope]].

> "Okay... [[Rat Scratch|Rat]], you know what to do."

[[Rat Scratch]] clicks and climbs through the small window. As he does, he drops his staff and it clatters on the stone steps inside.

> "What was that?" A voice comes from by the entrance.

[[Rat Scratch]] scurries quickly out from the stairwell and into a box-filled corner of the room.

A leather-bound [[Tabaxi]] comes past and inspects the stairs, then glances around. He pauses for a while before heading back to the entrance.

[[Rat Scratch]] waits a moment then follows, up to the door of the room he's in now.
He peeks around the doorway.
He sees two more doorways, then the guard sitting on a stool just by the entrance to the tower.

[[Rat Scratch]]'s eyes go dark and swirly as he clicks feverishly. The door guard suddenly sits up straight, his eyes wide with fear. He looks frantically down the corridor, his hands shaking. He stands up rapidly and backs quickly down the stairs behind him to the basement.
[[Rat Scratch]] slowly creeps up to where he went. He pulls the hatch down over the basement steps, then quickly leans out the door and whistles. The others quickly run into the tower.

[[Rat Scratch]] guestures emphatically at the basement hatch.

> "He's in there?" asks [[Snake]].

[[Rat Scratch]] nods.

> "We should find a way to trap him in" whispers [[Temitope]]. "It looks like there's no lock or bolt on this door."

[[Greeba]] points at one of the crates in the reception room they are standing by. [[Snake]] nods and they both try to quietly move the crate over the hatch.
They just about manage, when they start hearing voices from the room adjacent. [[Temitope]] waves them on and they all rush along towards the stairwell where [[Rat Scratch]] entered, as they hear footsteps leaving the kitchen.

As they climb the stairs, they hear behind them.

> "Where's Kond gone? I thought he was on watch?"
> "Probably gone down to the cellar to enjoy a drink with Fierta. You what they're up to don't you?"

> "They'll be coming up soon" whispers [[Snake]]. "Let's get a move on!"

They creep up the stairs to the second floor. Peering out, it appears to be empty and the continue along a corridor past two bedrooms.

[[Snake]] and [[Greeba]] head back in to the next set of stairs, but [[Temitope]] stops.

> "Aren't we going to search for the package?" she calls forwards.

> "It won't be in a common thief's room" says [[Snake]]. "It'll be somewhere important, probably at the top. Quickly! Before those two come up!"

They just make it up when [[The Order of Eye and Tooth|Order]] members come up and each split off to the two rooms.

On the next floor is a long corridor. The group quickly and quietly make their way along it to the end. It turns sharply to another corridor with two rooms.
[[Snake]] signals for [[Temitope]] to go and check them. She confirms they are empty, and the return to the stairwell.

This time [[Greeba]] comes up first and peers through two sets of doors and sees a cloaked figure in a study, peering closely at something on a table.

> "I think this is it" she whispers down. She moves along an adjacent corridor to allow the others to come up and see.

> "That's the package!" [[Temitope]] doesn't hesitate and crawls forward before [[Greeba]] can stop her.

She goes right up behind the cloaked man, draws her shortsword and stabs hard towards his side, but the sword tangles in his cloak and gets turned aside by his leather armor.

Startled, he steps back from the desk and draws a scimitar, facing off with [[Temitope]].

[[Greeba]], hearing his response, pushes past [[Temitope]] and launches into a flying kick at him. The kick hits him in the chest and he falls back, hitting his head against the wall.

[[Rat Scratch]] follows her and stands in the doorway. He raises a crooked hand and a darkness seems to grow around him. A black shadow fires from his hand and slams into the thief's arm. [[Rat Scratch]] ducks away from the door, allowing [[Snake]] to follow him to the doorway. He points and growls

> "Die, you thieving filth!"

The words seem to trigger an orange aura around [[Snake]]. The thief puts his hand to his forehead in pain, staggers a bit, then falls to the ground. As this happens, [[Snake]] hears voices from below.

> "Quick! They're coming up!"

[[Temitope]] grabs the item on the table, which seems to be giving off a dim light. She wraps it up and dashes out of the room. 
[[Greeba]] and [[Rat Scratch]] follow her down the stairs. [[Snake]] quickly looks around the floor before joining them, having seen nothing important.

[[Greeba]] comes face to face with on foe on the stairs, who stabs at her with his blade. It catches her in the side and she cries out in pain.
[[Temitope]] slides past her and spins with her sword and dagger, slashing his face. [[Greeba]] lifts a boot and kicks him, but he pushes her aside.

[[Rat Scratch]] scurries beneath their legs and comes up on the stair below. He pulls out a dagger and a sickle and does a cross strike at the back of the guy's legs. But as he falls, another comes up behind [[Rat Scratch]] and grabs him from behind.

[[Snake]] now makes his way down the stairs and comes to his friend's aid. As he passes [[Temitope]] he pats her shoulder, granting inspiration.

He then scratches at the face of the thief who is clutching [[Rat Scratch]], but he misses and ends up catching [[Rat Scratch]]!

[[Temitope]] tries to come down, but [[Greeba]] is blocking her way and is unsteady on her feet. So [[Temitope]] quickly hurls her dagger towards the final foe.

The dagger sticks in his shoulder and he cries out, but still doesn't let go of [[Rat Scratch]].

[[Greeba]] steels herself, and putting her hands on [[Temitope]] and [[Snake]]'s shoulders, swings both her feet down onto his head. He lets go of [[Rat Scratch]] and tumbles down the stairs, out of site.

[[Temitope]] and [[Snake]] pick [[Greeba]] up and they hobble down the stairs, where they find the dead body of their foe on the ground. They hurry to the tower entrance and rush off into the night.

Their escape is not easy with [[Greeba]] being wounded. 

> "How far can you go?" asks [[Temitope]]. "Do you think we'll make it to [[Hataqat]]?"

> "Remember we've still got to pass those guards we tricked" cuts in [[Snake]]. "We'd be better off heading direct south and picking up our journey."

> "Whatever, as long as we make camp somewhere safe, and not too far." groans [[Greeba]].
