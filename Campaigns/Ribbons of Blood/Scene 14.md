Scene: entering [[Hayfield]], morning
Interrupt!

[[Rat Scratch]] and [[Snake]] have just headed off to [[Hayfield]]. [[Greeba]] and [[Temitope]] settle in to wait for their return.

[[Temitope]] looks up at [[Greeba]], who is organising her pack.

> "You mentioned before... You're in some kind of debt. Can I ask what that is?"

[[Greeba]] stops what she's doing and sits back, looking into the distance. She sighs.

> "Before I was part of [[The Ribbon in the Sand|The Ribbon]] transport ships, I used to be on a pirate crew."

She pauses to watch [[Temitope]]'s reaction, which is not as shocked as she would have liked.

> "Nothing too bad, it was mostly robbing small ships moving between the towns on the [[Western Horn]]. We never killed anyone and what we were stealing was mostly basic goods that we could offload to [[The Order of Eye and Tooth|The Order]] for the black market."

> "But one day we got cocky. We got word of a cargo of precious metals that was just sitting unguarded. You ever heard of [[Yeledil]]?"

[[Temitope]] nods her head.

> "There's a [[The Ribbon in the Sand|Ribbon]] shipping yard there - their trade gateway to the northeast."

> "Exactly. Anyway, there was this barge full of metals being staged there for a few days. The plan was that we would dock at the mouth of the river and take small boats upstream at night, climb onboard and take all we could carry. Except not all of us got that message right. The idiot I was sharing a boat with took way too much, leapt back onto our boat and practically went through the bottom of it! We both went under and the noise raised the alarm."

> "Anyway, long story short I ended up in prison for four years before being released. And then [[The Ribbon in the Sand|The Ribbon]] came after me almost as soon as I got out - they don't easily forget debts like that. At first it was mostly working the oars, but I've managed to get a good position on the trade ships now - I might even be captain one day... This delivery is the last of my mandated tasks. After that I can be an employee rather than essentially a slave."

[[Temitope]] looks at [[Greeba]]. She is starting to feel a little more empathetic towards her.

> "I can see why you want this over with so quickly. I'm sorry it's been so difficult so far."

[[Greeba]] smiles, but says nothing.

It is at that moment that they hears shuffling around the edge of the dune behind them. [[Greeba]] stands.

> "Who's there? [[Snake]]? [[Rat Scratch|Rat]]? Is that you?"

They hear a "dammit! get them!" and several ragged individuals rush around the dune, swords and daggers drawn.
[[Greeba]] and [[Temitope]] rush at them and they clash.

These bandits are clearly desperate, and not very well trained. [[Greeba]] manages to avoid most of their attacks. [[Temitope]] rushes between them, giving [[Greeba]] good opportunities to flank, but despite her nimbleness she takes a few crossbow bolts as well as nicks from their swords.

Eventually, they all go down and [[Temitope]] and [[Greeba]] collapse, tired and bloody onto the sand.

Once they've caught their breath, they go about dealing with the bodies. The weaponry they carry isn't the best, but [[Temitope]] takes one of the crossbows for herself.
They also take some of the rough leather armour and keep it aside in case [[Snake]] wants it.

They also find 12 gold, 9 silver, and some copper. [[Temitope]] generously (for her) splits it with [[Greeba]].
They also find a deck of cards on one of the bandits, in surprisingly good condition.
[[Temitope]] takes a look at it and determines that this is indeed a magic deck - some kind of destructive magic.

> "I think [[Snake]] might get better use out of this than me." says [[Temitope]]. "I know magic, but am not much of a magic user."

> "I don't even know magic." says [[Greeba]].

After looting, they take some time to dig a pit and bury the bodies off to way from the camp. [[Temitope]] takes care to brush away their tracks from around this grave.

> "They didn't seem like the sort of people who would be missed, but you never know." she says.
