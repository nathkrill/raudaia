Scene: Morning, cliffs

As the group pack up and set off in the morning, they are surprised to find that not far from their camp, a hunched bundle has appeared out in the open.

[[Rat Scratch]] cautiosly approaches it, and prods it with his staff. He jumps back and gives a squawk.

The others come over to see a sandy, shrivelled old man. He is clearly dead, but nothing has obviously killed him.

> "He probably got lost in the storm" offers [[Temitope]]. "I wonder what he's doing out here?"

[[Snake]] starts digging around in the old man's robes. There is a small pouch with two gelatinous beads that are potentially edible? There's also a twisted wooden staff with a bird head at the top.

> "I know how to use that!" [[Temitope]] is eager to partake in some loot this time.

She grabs the staff and raises it up and out. The eyes of the bird at the top glow yellow and the mouth opens, letting out a loud eagle shriek! Everyone jumps in surprise except [[Rat Scratch]], who echoes the call with precision.

> "That's all it does?" [[Temitope]] seems disappointed yet again.

[[Greeba]] chuckles.

> "It might come in handy, you know, if we need to summon some pidgeons!"

[[Temitope]] scowls and tucks the staff into her straps at the back.

> "I guess we just leave mystery man and travel on?" says [[Greeba]]. "I doubt anyone will come chasing us for some old wanderer's bird stick."

She turns and they follow as she continues on down the slopes.

The downward travelling is a lot easier than before. The sun is less strong today in the wake of the storm, and they move quickly onward. They even press on into the night before stopping to make camp. It's a peaceful night, and [[Rat Scratch]] is pleased to see the clouds part and the stars shine down as he keeps watch and meditates. He doesn't hear anything from his patron.

Now on flat ground, they keep going in the direction they were the day before. As the day draws on, [[Snake]] is surprised to see buildings in the distance - some sort of town!

> "Here we go!" He exclaims. "Our first proper [[Alkhara Desert|Alkhara]] community. We could go there tomorrow and replenish, or we could avoid it and stay incognito. Thoughts?"

> "I'd like to not be spotted at all." Pipes up [[Temitope]]. "We've had enough trouble already."

> "I'm all for avoiding trouble" says [[Greeba]]. "But I could do with a proper bed and to get some decent supplies."

> "How about we make camp here, and you two stay in camp, out of sight and out of the way. Then [[Rat Scratch|Rat]] and I go into the village and resupply. I'm sorry it won't mean you get a good bed, [[Greeba]], but such is the way of things out here."

> "Fine. But make sure you don't draw attention, and that you get at least a decent amount of water." says [[Greeba]].

They search around and find a good place to camp, nestled between two rising dunes just north of the village.
As the others rest, [[Rat Scratch]] keeps his usual watch. He doesn't see anything of interest besides a strange illumination of the sky to the south. He watches it for a time, but doesn't bother waking anyone about it.
