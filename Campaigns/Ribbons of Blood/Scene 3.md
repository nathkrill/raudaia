Scene: Tavern Interior
Expected Scene

As [[Temitope]], [[Snake]], and [[Rat Scratch]] enter the cool tavern interior, [[Greeba]] is already speaking to the bartender, a sun-shrunken older man.

He goes into a back room and brings out four large satchels handing each in turn to [[Greeba]] who places them beside a benched table.

[[Rat Scratch]] goes and sits patiently at the bench, his small beaked head barely reaching over the edge. [[Snake]] wanders around the tavern, examining the plates and mugs of the patrons and getting some strange looks.

[[Temitope]] joins [[Greeba]] at the bar.

> "Are these our supplies? You can't really expect me to carry that beastly thing around with me, can you?"

[[Greeba]] slams a bag down on the ground.

> "You'll carry what you need, or you'll starve or die of thirst. You pull your weight out in the desert if you want to make it to [[Asmadah]]."

[[Temitope]] looks disapprovingly at the large bag at her feet. She shoves it with her foot towards the bench and sits down alongside [[Rat Scratch]].

As [[Snake]] finally makes his way back to the bench, [[Greeba]] also sits and places four cups and a jug of juice on the table.

> "Drink up - this will be our last unrationed meal."

The bartender brings a platter of fruit and dried meat, placing it beside the jug.

The group eat in silence, until [[Temitope]] speaks up.

> "So you do have a route planned, don't you, [[Snake]]? How long will we be on the road?"

[[Snake]] drains his cup and speaks as he pours another.

> "Like I said, it's hard to plan the specifics when crossing the desert. But the main goal is to travel south through the pass and try to join the road by one of the towns just past the mountains. Then we can follow the caravans as they go east to [[Asmadah]]."

He pulls out a ragged parchment with a crude pencil sketch of the region, with [[Palerabi]] at the top and a long, wavy line indicating the road south of some jagged mountain peaks. There are no names marked on the map, so it takes [[Temitope]] a moment to figure out their location. [[Snake]]'s finger taps gently where [[Asmadah]] is, at the eastern end of the road.

> "There should be plenty of towns to stop at for rest and supplies. With good fortune, this won't be challenging."

> "Good," replies [[Temitope]]. "We can't afford to make any mistakes here. This package is too important to take chances on."

As she draws attention to the bundle tied around her, [[Rat Scratch]] tries to lean in and take a peak beneath the wraps.
[[Temitope]] immediately grabs it and swings the bundle around to the other side.

> "Oh no! The contents of this must remain secret. Only I can know what's in here. It's for your own safety."

> "Fine by me." Grunts [[Greeba]]. "We done eating? Let's get on the road. the quicker we leave, the sooner I can be back where I belong."

She stands, picks up a pack, and heads to the tavern door.

[[Snake]] grabs a few more handfuls of dried meat and stuffs them into his pocket, then he and [[Rat Scratch]] each take packs and saunter out as well.
[[Temitope]] struggles as she lifts her pack, wobbles, and trots after them.
