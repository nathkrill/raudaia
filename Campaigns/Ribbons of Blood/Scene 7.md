Scene: Road leading up to [[The Nest]].
Interrupt scene

The sun is beginning to sink below the horizon as the group make their way east along the dusty road.
It's not long before they come across an encampment set up alongside the road. There are some carts pulled up, blocking most of the road.

As they approach, an armoured individual steps out from behind the carts.

> "Halt! Please stop right there for an inspection!"

Two more figures come out, dressed in soldier's gear. The group look at each other, puzzled. Even [[Snake]] seems confused as he addresses the pair coming towards them.

> "Hello, friends. May I ask what is going on?"

> "Greetings, travellers. We are the guard from [[Kuagan]]. There has been an increase in criminal activity here and we are making sure everyone passing through is an honourable citizen. Please prepare to be searched for contraband."

> "I assure you, we have no bad intention." purrs [[Snake]]. "You will find nothing of any concern on our persons."

He lowers his pack to the floor as he speaks, and signals for the others to do the same.

The guards look at each other.

> "I'll tell you what. Rather than waste our time going through your belongings, why don't you perhaps help us out with some coin, and you may be on your way. I'm sure you'll want to reach your destination before nightfall."

[[Snake]] narrows his eyes at them.

> "I appreciate the offer, but we'll gladly take on the inspection."

[[Greeba]] glares at him. He waves her down.

The guards shift impatiently. The other speaks up.

> "Like he said, it's not needed, just pay the tax and you can be on your way."

> "Tax?" [[Temitope]] pipes up. "There are no taxes here, by order of the [[Lord of Salt]]."

The guard frowns. He puts his hand on his sword hilt.

> "And who are you to say that? We ought to know, being civil servants."

[[Snake]] holds up his hands.

> "Okay, okay, there's no need for that. This is just unexpected is all. Let's calm down and see if we can come to an arrangement."

He steps forward and puts an arm around the guard, pulling him aside. 

> "Hey! No hands on us!" He pulls away.

[[Snake]] shrinks back. He waves his hands behind his back, casting Charm Person.

> "I'm sorry, sir. Just trying to be friendly."

The guard shakes his head, a funny look in his eyes.

> "It's... it's okay. I get it, we're all on edge here. Why don't you and I chat over here."

[[Snake]] and the guard go off to the side while the other keeps his eyes on the rest of the group.
They come back shortly and the guard announces loudly.

> "Okay! They've paid up, let them pass."

The one who stayed looks at his friend strangely, but reluctantly waves them on and they escort the group between the carts and through to the road again.

Once a bit further along, [[Snake]] says:

> "Let's pick up the pace, get a good distance from them. Before long they'll realise I cast a charm and will come after us, for sure."

They hurry on, keeping an eye out behind them as well as looking around for signs of [[The Nest]].
