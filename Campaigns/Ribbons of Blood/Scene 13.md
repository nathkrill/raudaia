Scene: morning, entry to the village.
Interrupt

Early in the morning, everyone wakes up and gets ready. [[Snake]] and [[Rat Scratch]] adjust their packs to make sure there is room for any new supplies. [[Greeba]] and [[Temitope]] make sure the camp is still well hidden, and ready to pack up quickly if they get discovered.

> "I have the glowing orb" says [[Snake]], "if you have to move and are not here when I return, I will wait until nightfall. Then I will go out into the flats and shine the bright light. You will find me then."

[[Greeba]] and [[Temitope]] nod in agreement.

[[Snake]] begins scaling the southern dune when he suddenly stops, ducks down and slides back towards camp.

> "Shh!" he waves his arms.

Everyone stops.

> "What is it?"

> "There's another camp just beyond the dune. A cart and a tent."

> "What? Do you think they know we are here?" [[Temitope]] beings to panic.

> "I cannot tell. [[Temitope|Temi]], come with me and let's take a look."

[[Temitope]] and [[Snake]] climb slowly up the sloping dune and lay flat on their fronts, peeking out over the crest.

They see a small camp, a little different from theirs. There is a horse and carriage, and a domed tent set up. A kettle is boiling over a small campfire.
A lone figure stands by the kettle, a book in hand.

[[Snake]] notices that the figure is an elven man, with long flowing robes. He has a tall pointed hood.

> "He doesn't look one of [[The Order of Eye and Tooth|The Order]]." he whispers. "What should we do? The moment we leave our camp area he will spot us."

[[Temitope]] rolls onto her back, thinking.

> "Well, it's four of us and one of him." she points out. "We could all come over together and confront him."

> "Worth a try I suppose." [[Snake]] replies. "Let's ask [[Greeba]]."

They silently slide back down the dune and into camp. [[Snake]] describes the man and [[Temitope]] gives her suggestion.

> "Seems risky." says [[Greeba]]. "We could always wait for him to leave."

> "I thought you didn't want to waste time?" retorts [[Temitope]]. "What about you, [[Rat Scratch]]?"

[[Rat Scratch]] does his little head twitch. He stands still for a moment, his black eyes glazed over.
Then, he turns and sits back on his bedroll. 

> "So we're not in agreement, then." says [[Temitope]]. "That's not helpful."

> "A lack of consensus means we do nothing." say [[Greeba]] firmly.

> "Excuse me, but I couldn't help overhear a conversation." says a voice.

They all suddenly turn. [[Temitope]] draws her sword.

> "I'm not quite sure what you may be discussing, but if it's guidance you need, I can offer wisdom."

> "Who are you? What do you want?" starts [[Temitope]] immediately.

[[Snake]] puts a hand on her shoulder, trying to settle her.

> "Forgive my friend. It can be hard out in the wilderness to know who to trust. We are open to discourse with you, should you provide us some assurance of good faith."

> "I appreciate your apology." replies the robed man, who is now coming down from the dune.

 [[Temitope]] steps back as he approaches, but [[Snake]] shakes his hand.

> "Allow me to introduce myself. I am [[Mathari]]. I come from the west. I am a wizard of the [[Council of the Mystics]] - perhaps you've heard of it? I can provide credentials."

He reaches into his robe and pulls out a medallion, engraved with layers of symbology.
[[Temitope]] steps forward.

> "Let me see that."

She grabs the medallion and looks closely at the markings then returns it to [[Mathari]].

> "You have this, sure. but how do we know that you are really who you say you are?"

> "I can provide no assurances other than my word and this token." he replies patiently. "If you wish to be left alone, this is fine. But if you are willing to engage with me, I may be able to be useful to you."

> "One moment, please." [[Snake]] raises a clawed finger and waves the group to one side. "I do not think we have much to fear from this man. If he wanted to attack us he would have done already."

> "But what if he's looking for the package?" says [[Temitope]]. "He might just be biding his time to confirm if we have it before striking."

> "A fair point." says [[Greeba]]. "If he wants to leave us alone then he can. We have things to do."

> "I was always taught that an offer from a person of wisdom is always meant to be taken seriously." beings [[Snake]]. "Especially if they are offering it freely, which this one appears to be. What is the harm in at least hearing him out and then if we don't like it we can dismiss him."

No-one has anything else to say to that, so [[Snake]] turns back to [[Mathari]].

> "Wise friend, please, do share with us what you will. We are open to your wisdom. I fit helps, we are nothing but simple travellers making our way east across the desert. We were just about to enter the village here and resupply. We have a long way to go."

> "It is always nice to meet the common traveller on these roads." replies the wizard, bowing his head slightly. "You find yourself outside the town of [[Hayfield]], the final stop on the road out of the west. A good place to find rest and supply. Talk to [[Kiyan]] in the trader's hall. He is a trustworthy merchant who can get what you will need."

At this [[Snake]]'s eyes open widely. He had completely misjudged where they were! This could set back their journey. But he doesn't show his concern now.

> "Thank you, that is good to know." [[Snake]] bows his head respectfully.

> "And if I may" continues the wizard. "I know not where you are headed, but if you are going east across the desert you may want to go due east from here and join the trade route at [[Tutham]]. Those are well travelled paths and you will find may places to stop and rest along your way."

He pauses for a moment, staring past them to the east.

> "If I might ask something of you, in return for this guidance. I have much business here in the desert, and more immediately I am drawn to the north. But if you find yourselves near [[Yafat]] I would appreciate you checking in on my elder, [[Alfor]]. He took a trip there some time ago and none of my order have heard from him. Do not feel obliged, but if you can, send word to me in [[Mazira]]."

[[Snake]] nods his head. 

> "Should fate take us along this road, we will do this for you - as a show of thankfulness for your wisdom and advice."

Both [[Greeba]] and [[Temitope]] roll their eyes at [[Snake]]'s words. Neither of them have the intention of straying from their path, but won't say that straight to the wizard.

The wizard [[Mathari]] bids his goodbyes and steps back over the dune. 

> "You see?" says [[Snake]]. "We know where we are and what we should do. And it has not cost us anything but a short conversation."

[[Temitope]] huffs. 

> "I don't suppose you are planning on finding this friend of his? Sounds like a waste of time."

> "I spoke the truth." explains [[Snake]]. "If we find ourselves there by the winds of fate, I will honour this man in that way. But we may not go this way, who can tell?"

He sits down for a moment.

> "More urgently, I must share something with you."

The others join him.

> "I know this town, [[Hayfield]]. We are too far to the west here. We may have added at least two days onto our journey. This is why it is important we resupply."

> "Two days!" says [[Greeba]] angrily. "How did you get us so lost? I thought we were making good progress."

> "The desert can be a tricky mistress." Replies [[Snake]]. "Like your precious ocean, things are changeable and difficult to read. But it is fine. [[Rat Scratch|Rat]] and I will go and resupply, and we can go the right way this time."

[[Snake]] and [[Rat Scratch]] go back up to the top of the dune. [[Mathari]]'s cart is already on the move and they head on out towards [[Hayfield]].
