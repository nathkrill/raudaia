Scene: Morning, Camp
Interrupt: Betray Business

[[Temitope]] is the first awake in the morning. She turns over and sees [[Rat Scratch]] dusting off the markings he left in the sand last night. Sitting up, she watches the strange creature as it chirps and whistles to itself.

> "[[Snake]] says you are cursed by something." She says. "Do you have some evil spirit or something?"

[[Rat Scratch]] stops abruptly and looks up at her.

> "... Cursed?... Evil?..." he chirps, clearly offended by these terms.

He shakes his head and kicks some sand towards [[Temitope]].

> "Hey!"

She falls back, rubbing sand out of her face. As she falls back, the bundle which she kept tied about her even as she slept is knocked aside, and it's contents spill out onto the ground.

> "Look what you did!" she cries. "We need to treat this with care..."

Her shout wakes up [[Snake]] and [[Greeba]], who both sit up groggily and watch as she reprimands [[Rat Scratch]], who is tapping his foot aggressively as she looms down on him.

[[Temitope]] turns to pick up the bundle and wrap it up with care when she suddenly starts.

> "What!?"

The others perk up even more at her outburst, clearly something is wrong here.

[[Temitope]] picks up the bundle and turns towards the others, moving aside the cloth wrapping to reveal... A melon!

> "That's what we're out here in the desert for?" says [[Greeba]] angrily. "What a waste of my time..."

> "No! You don't understand!" says [[Temitope]].  "This isn't the package! Someone's switched it! Which one of you did this!"

She turns her gaze immediately to [[Rat Scratch]]. Who backs off, raising up his hands. [[Temitope]] stamps towards him.

> "If you've taken this, you're in serious trouble!" She draws a small dagger from her belt and waves it threateningly at the bird.

[[Snake]] dashes over and stands between the two.

> "Now, let's not get hasty here. [[Rat Scratch|Rat]] doesn't care about such things. He's just here to keep my company."

> "You said it yourself, he's cursed! I bet whatever evil spirit he's got made him take it."

> "I never said cursed. Whatever relationship he has with this power... it is not bad. It helps a lot actually."

[[Greeba]] reluctantly gets to her feet.

> "Okay, that's enough. Let's end this quickly. Everyone, empty your bags. We'll see soon enough who has the package."

[[Temitope]] glares at her.

> "Okay, but *him* first". She points the dagger at [[Rat Scratch]].

In turn, they all empty out their packs and belongings. [[Rat Scratch]] has a very strange collection of items: bones, rocks, and sticks, but not the package.
[[Snake]] and [[Greeba]] also only have some personal effects and their travelling gear.

[[Temitope]] sinks to the ground.

> "Where could it be? I had it with me the entire time, from when I left the archive in [[Raunum]]."

> "Perhaps someone took it from you in the tavern?" offers [[Snake]].

> "We're not going all the way back!" declares [[Greeba]].

> "We have to! We can't carry on without the thing we're supposed to deliver!" [[Temitope]] is agitated gesturing wildly, still with the dagger in hand.

> "She's right", says [[Snake]]. "We must go back."

[[Greeba]] sighs loudly.

> "I just want this over with... Fine. Let's go."

They pack up their things and [[Snake]] leads them back across the sand towards [[Hataqat]].

On the road, [[Greeba]] asks [[Temitope]]:

> "So, are you going to tell us what it is now? It's going to be hard to find if we don't know what we're looking for."

> "All you need to know is that it's about the size of that melon."

She waves her hand at [[Snake]] and [[Rat Scratch]], who are both tucking into slices of the melon.

> "Keep an eye out for anything that size and shape and I'll verify if it's ours when we get our hands on it."

They make good time, following the route they went the day before and come to [[Hataqat]] in the afternoon.
