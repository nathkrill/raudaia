Scene: [[Hataqat]], tavern

[[Temitope]] storms straight into the tavern and up to the bar. The barkeeper hears her angry entrance and turns towards her. It's not the same man as before but a similar woman.

> "We were robbed in your tavern yesterday. I want to speak to the man who was behind the bar." demands [[Temitope]].

> "Excuse me!?" comes the reply. "You can't come in here making demands and accusations. Get lost!"

If possible, [[Temitope]] goes even more red.

> "I'm serious! Your tavern is responsible for the wellbaing of it's patrons and you've let us down! We need to settle this matter!"

The barkeep is taken aback by this angry young woman.

> "Fine! Fine! I'll go and get him. Keep your horns on."

She turns and heads up a back stairway. Soon after, the man from yesterday comes down, frowning.

> "What's this about a robbery?" he asks.

[[Temitope]] puts both hands on the bar and leans forward.

> "We were here yesterday, and have discovered that one of our possessions, something particularly valuable, has gone missing. I'd like you to either own up to it's disappearance, or help us locate the people responsible."

> "Well, miss." he says, folding his arms. "I'm not owning up to anything. As for finding a culprit, look around. These are the same folk here that were yesterday. They're all simple folk. I doubt any of them even noticed you all, let alone stole from you."

[[Snake]] sidles up to [[Temitope]] at the bar, his cat eyes looking deeply at the barkeep.

> "I don't think that's true... I took a good look around yesterday and these aren't the same. I think you ought to be more truthful to the young lady."

> "Okay!" he holds up his hands. "There was someone else here. There's an [[The Order of Eye and Tooth|Eye and Tooth]] [[The Nest|Nest]] a shortways out of town - on the pass to [[Kuagan]]. One of their folks was here collecting protection money yesterday. If something's missing, you can bet it would be them."

> "Much appreciated." [[Snake]] nods.

He slides a gold coin across the bar an taps it gently.

> "You can count on us not to tell how we found that out."

He puts his arm around [[Temitope]], turning her around and they turn to join [[Greeba]] and [[Rat Scratch]] by the door.

> "[[The Order of Eye and Tooth|Eye and Tooth]]!" Whispers [[Temitope]] agressively. "This is serious! We can't just go there and ask for it back!"

> "We can at least go there and take a look." says [[Snake]]. "We should make our decision from a well-informed point of view."

[[Greeba]] snorts at this.

> "So yet another detour. Let's try and make this one quick."

[[Temitope]] glares at her.

> "You don't seem to be taking this seriously. Don't you care about this?"

> "Honestly, no. I just want out of this damned desert and back on my ship where I belong. It's far too dry out here." comes the reply.

> "So what are you doing here then?"

> "If you must know, I owe the [[The Ribbon in the Sand|Ribbon]] a debt of sorts. I do this and I'll be able to go about my business without any trouble. That's all I want, no trouble. But this whole thing seems like it's going to attract nothing but that. I'll be lucky to survive, let alone get what I want."

> "Let's not waste any more time, then." says [[Snake]].

He pushes them all out the door and they find the road east towards [[Kuagan]].
