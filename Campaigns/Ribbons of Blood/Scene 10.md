Scene: Travel, wilderness

As they travel, a strong wind picks up, throwing sand into their faces. The sun is even obscured by the gusts whipping it around them.
As a result, [[Snake]] struggles to lead them in the correct direction and they end up heading west more than south.

> "Maybe we'll end up back in [[Hataqat]] after all" says [[Temitope]] glumly.

In the night, as [[Rat Scratch]] keeps watch, her sits bolt upright to hear raised voices out in the darkness. He quickly douses the campfire and gently wakes [[Snake]]. They remain low and listen carefully to what's being said.

> "I'm telling you, the trail leads this way! Even with the storm, the tracks are quite fresh. We've got to be catching up to them."

[[Rat Scratch]] sees two leather-clad figures crouched in the dark, examining the ground in the direction the group had travelled that day. He and [[Snake]] go and silently wake [[Greeba]] and [[Temitope]], pulling them back from camp. [[Snake]] tries to cover their tracks as they do so.

They watch as the thieves (they appear to be [[The Order of Eye and Tooth|Order]]) agents follow the tracks to the camp. [[Snake]] keeps his hand steady , then as they start to inspect their packs, he raises it to signal to strike.

[[Greeba]], barely able to see, sprints forwards and begins pumelling the one with the lantern. He cries out in shock as she beats him down.

[[Snake]] grips a claw on [[Temitope]]'s arm, giving inspiration. He then sticks to the shadows and circles towards the other thief.

[[Temitope]] follows him and bursts into the light, diving with her blades at the enemy.

[[Rat Scratch]] remains in the dark, and raises his staff. Shadows creep from the ground and seem to cling to the thief's legs. He then swings it down and a familiar black bolt flies out to them, but flies past them into the dark.

[[Greeba]] quickly dispatches her foe, despite taking a small nick to her arm. As she and [[Temitope]] flank either side of the remaining thief, [[Snake]] steps towards him.

> "You must be with [[The Order of Eye and Tooth|The Order]]... This doesn't look good for you, friend. I suggest you surrender and give up this chase."

> "You can't take from us and kill without repercussion! We will keep coming, I promise!" Shouts the thief in return. [[Temitope]] has heard enough and steps forward and runs him through. Blood stains the sand.

[[Rat Scratch]] joins them by the campfire and flicks his wrist to light it up as they inspect the bodies.

They find a total of 15gp between the two thieves, and [[Snake]] and [[Temitope]] split it between them.
[[Snake]] also takes a scimitar from one of them, and [[Temitope]] finds some thief tools to use.

Then, [[Greeba]] and [[Snake]] drag the bodies off to one side and bury them in the sand while [[Rat Scratch]] goes around clearing the blood from the sand with his magic.

They managed to take the rest of the night without incident.

> "We're holding ourselves well" states [[Greeba]] with some surprise. "Even you, [[Temitope|Temi]]." It seems she has warmed to [[Temitope]] having seen her dispatch a few foes quite aggressively.

The next day of travel is good. A clear sky allows [[Snake]] to see the pass between the mountain ranges to the east and west and head straight for it. That night they make camp just short of where the terrain begins to rise up.
