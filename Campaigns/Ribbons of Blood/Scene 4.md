Scene: Outside of town, desert,early afternoon
Altered Scene: remove object

The group have barely made it to the edge of town, when [[Temitope]] stops and stamps her foot on the hard, sandy ground.

> "I'm telling you, I can't do this!"

The others stop and slowly turn towards her.

> "There's no way I'm carrying this ridiculous pack halfway across the desert! Do you realise that if I go down from exhaustion, this mission is over. You cannot deliver the package properly without me!"

> "And why might that be?" demands [[Greeba]]. "I don't see why we can't just leave you behind and take the thing ourselves."

> "Because, because..." [[Temitope]] stammers, looking for an excuse. "You're not qualified to handle items of this importance, that's why! You might damage it, or present it in an inappropriate manner. You don't even know what it is."

> "I've made deliveries before without knowing their contents" says [[Snake]]. "II doubt this is any different."

> "Well, it is." says [[Temitope]] defiantly. She takes the pack and throws it to the ground.

> "Fine." [[Greeba]] turns and begins walking off. "We won't share with you."

[[Snake]] shrugs and follows her, but then [[Rat Scratch]] begins squawking. He rushes up the [[Snake]] and grabs his cloak with his beak and begins pulling.

> "I'm sorry, [[Rat Scratch|Rat]]" says Snake. "But we can't carry her share. If she won't take it, that's it for her."

[[Rat Scratch]] stands beside [[Temitope]] and watches the others as they walk on. He twitches his head towards her.

> "Starve" he chirps, and shrugs questioningly.

[[Temitope]] sighs and watches her companions get further away. She groans and grabs the pack, rummaging through it.

> "There's got to be some way to lighten the load."

It takes a while to get everything out on the ground, and [[Greeba]] and [[Snake]] are getting further and further ahead. [[Rat Scratch]] stays by her side, watching silently.

Eventually, she finds some rope, a crowbar, and surprisingly, a large bell. Discarding these, she shoulders the pack and trudges after the others, with [[Rat Scratch]] at her heel.

> Travel Roll: Survival @ disadvantage: 10.

On the first day, they make good progress, despite having to allow time for [[Temitope]] and [[Rat Scratch]] to catch up.
As the sun sinks low, they settle in and make a camp beside a low rocky ridge.

[[Temitope]] throws her pack down and sits with her back to the group as [[Snake]] and [[Rat Scratch]] build a fire.
[[Greeba]] lays out her bedroll and sits, taking a drink and bite to eat.
[[Snake]] plucks at his lute, while [[Rat Scratch]] begins wandering around their camp, scratching symbols into the dirt.
[[Temitope]] notices this and comes out of her sulk.

> "What's he doing?" she asks [[Snake]].

> "He does that everywhere we stop for a while." Replies [[Snake]]. "[[Rat Scratch|Rat]] has some strange connection to a dark power. It gives him strength and guidance, but also makes him a little... Eccentric."

[[Temitope]] glances at [[Rat Scratch]]. Suspicion build in her eyes.

There is little conversation as they each eat and relax for a while. Before long, [[Temitope]] stands and moves back from the fire, laying out her bedroll.

[[Snake]] puts his lute down and stretches out. He too grabs his bedroll before turning to [[Greeba]].

> "Feel free to sleep. [[Rat Scratch|Rat]] can keep watch - he doesn't sleep like the rest of us."

> "Fine by me."

Says [[Greeba]], and she too turns in.

[[Rat Scratch]] completes his scratching, then comes and sits on the sand by the fire. He turns his eyes skywards and the blackness within them seem to swirl and grow even deeper.
The darkness grows nearer, as if there is a solid wall around the camp. The smoke from the fire seems to form a billowing figure. 
[[Rat Scratch]] cocks his head expectantly. The smoke swirls around him, before gently floating onto [[Greeba]]'s sleeping figure, like a dark cloak about her shoulders.
[[Rat Scratch]]'s eyes widen, then he nods and relaxes, allowing the vision to dissipate.

While [[Rat Scratch]] communes with his patron, he fails to notice a hunched, cloaked figure watching the camp at a distance...
