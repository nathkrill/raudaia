Scene: [[Hataqat]], outside, noon.
! Interrupt scene !

Deep in the [[Starved Wastes]], under the cover of night in the flat, frigid and forgotten plains, a small group of workers are digging. They dig silently, the only noise is the scraping of their picks and shovels and the sound of dry soil scattering on the ground.

Suddenly, on gives a small yelp. They all stop and stare. Someone lights a lantern. They all peer down to where the ground has given way to a stone-walled chamber beneath the dirt. A pale blue light trickles out, reflecting in their wondrous eyes.
