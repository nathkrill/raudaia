Scene: Camp, Night

That night, as [[Rat Scratch]] keeps watch over the camp in the gloom, he once again falls into a trance. The smoke from the campfire billows into the monstrous figure.
Like before, it looms over [[Greeba]]'s sleeping form, drawing [[Rat Scratch]] in.

He hesitates, unsure if he should approach her. Then gives in and slowly walks up to her.

The smoke is gently resting over her, with tendrils of it spilling down her side. But as [[Rat Scratch]] approaches, the smoke dissipates and vanishes into the night air. [[Rat Scratch]] is left standing over his companion, not knowing what these signs mean.

In the morning, the group wake and begin having some breakfast. [[Rat Scratch]] is standing moodily off at a distance, staring at the horizon across the sandy wastes.

While they eat, [[Snake]] turns to [[Temitope]].

> "After all that with [[The Order of Eye and Tooth|The Order]], are you still not going to tell us what it is we are transporting? It looked like it was glowing when I got a glimpse of it in [[The Nest]]."

[[Temitope]]'s hand rests subtly on the bundle at her side. She takes a deep breath.

> "Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm still not sure if I trust you enough for that. But I understand that you're all going through a lot of trouble on behalf of this, so I'll tell you this:"

She pauses for a moment, then continues:

> "We've called it the '[[Glacial Mind]]'. I can't reveal to you what it does, but I will say it is magical in nature. It was found out in the [[Starved Wastes]], and it's application can have huge implications, especially at a political level. That is why it's so desirable."
> "What worries me about what happened with [[The Order of Eye and Tooth|The Order]] is - did they know? Was it a planned theft or just the result of an opportunistic thief? I guess we're on their radar either way, now, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone leaked information about our journey. We need to be very careful."

[[Snake]] sits back on his heels and thinks for a moment.

> "Perhaps it is best that we avoid too much contact with civilisation. We can try some routes that avoid the main road and only pass through very small villages. That way we remain incognito."

[[Temitope]] nods.

> "I would appreciate that. [[Greeba]], what do you think?"

[[Greeba]] looks up with a mouthful and shrugs.

> "So long as we don't detour too much. I still want this over as quickly as possible."

They have another good day of travel, slowly making their ascent as they head further south. At the end of the day they reach the peak of the pass and set a camp.
An uneventful night passes.

The next day is the beginning of their descent down into the [[Alkhara Desert]] properly. It seems like with every 10 minutes of their descent the air grows hotter as the sun blazes.
At around noon, the sun is so bright in their eyes that it's getting very hard to see anything at all. [[Snake]], who is leading in front as ususal, suddenly puts a foot forward and with a yelp, disappears from view!

The others rush forward to see that there is a sudden edge and drop in the cliffside, which falls down into a deep but narrow chasm. Sliding down, with his claws embedded in the soft sandy wall is [[Snake]]. He is tumbling and bashing the edges, but thankfully isn't freefalling. He hits the bottom with a soft, sandy slam!

[[Temitope]] and [[Rat Scratch]] come right to the edge.

> "[[Snake]]! Are you okay?!" cries [[Temitope]] down into the pit.

[[Snake]] sits up, rubbing his arms and knees.

> "I'm okay, mostly. How do I get out?"

[[Greeba]] has already pulled a rope out from her pack. She wraps it around her wrist and tosses the other end down. 

> "Grab hold. [[Temitope|Temi]], help me pull him up."

Thankfully, the rope reaches down to the bottom and [[Snake]] is able to grab the end. It's a joint effort, and [[Snake]] has to do a bit of climbing, but having the rope around his waist, he is able to eventually climb out. By the time he does so, the sun is already starting to sink below the horizon.

They drag [[Snake]] up the ledge and sit him upright. [[Rat Scratch]] rushes around him, chirping and croaking.

> "Okay?! Okay?!"

> Yes, [[Rat Scratch|Rat]]. I'm fine".

[[Snake]] is out of breath, but seems mostly unharmed. He holds out his hand, which has something in it.

> "I found this down there."

They all look closely. It's a solid glass globe, partially transparent. There are some runes etched across the face, spanning and crossing each other.

[[Temitope]] looks closely, reading the infernal runes out loud. As she speaks the words, the globe begins to glow a bright light, almost so bright she can't read any more! Then as she reads the next, it dims to a lantern-light. With the final set of words, it rises up out of [[Snake]]'s hands and hovers in place above them.
With the fourth word, the globe sinks back down into his hand and the light fades.

> "That'll come in handy" remarks [[Greeba]] - the only one of the group who cannot see in the dark.

[[Snake]] tosses the globe in the air and catches it again.

> "You will have to teach me those words, [[Temitope]]. I would very much like to use this."

[[Temitope]] is a little upset that she cannot have the globe for herself, but nods politely at [[Snake]]. She then changes the subject.

> "I suppose there's no point trying to go any further in the dark. Shall we make camp?"

The others agree and they set up for the night.

That night, a howling wind picks up a vicious sand-storm. They tuck into one of the cliff-faces for shelter and although broken, sleep does come to the rest of the group as [[Rat Scratch]] keeps his usual vigil.
