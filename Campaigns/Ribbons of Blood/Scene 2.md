Scene: [[Hataqat]], outside, noon.
Expected Scene

The noonday sun beats down on the small town of [[Hataqat]]. A slight breeze flows through the streets, bringing with it the usual sandy stream which bites at the heels of any brave enough to be outside at the peak of the sun's oppressive heat.

[[Greeba]] is one such person. She stands out in the open, arms folded, leaning against the stone edge of a well which is located in the square just outside of an impressive sandstone keep.

The keep, which covers almost as much area as the rest of the town itself, looms quietly behind her. There is no sound as many of the denizens of the town find shelter from the heat within their stone houses, some even heading deeper below ground into cool cellars and basement lounges.

[[Greeba]] sighs and glances around once more, checking each of the two roads that come in to the west and south corners of the open square for signs of anyone approaching. She has been out here far too long, the heat is getting to her.

Just as she thinks about taking a moment to head back to the tavern where she began her day, through the haze she spots two blurry figures approaching from the south road. She stands up straight ready to greet them.

As they come closer and the haze lifts, she sees a bright orange cat-like figure and a stark, shrunken figure in black approach. These are people she is somewhat familiar with - [[Snake]] and [[Rat Scratch]]. Her [[Tabaxi]] navigator on this expedition and his curious [[Kenku]] companion.

The sidle up to her and, catching her gaze, [[Snake]] acknowledges her frustration.

> "Sorry we're late. I took a small doze beneath a tree and [[Rat Scratch|Rat]] here was too busy wandering to bother waking me up."

The break of his companion clicks and they chirp a little and their beady black eyes narrow as they shake their head in protest.

> "...Err... Wandering"

[[Rat Scratch]] croaks, suggesting that's not the best description for what they were doing but offering no further explanation.

> "Whatever," sighs [[Greeba]], "we're still waiting on the asset anyway."

Used to the cool coastal breeze, [[Greeba]] is clearly struggling with the dry heat in this part of the [[Kara Valley]].

They wait in silence for a while. [[Snake]] swings a small lute off his back and begins plucking a discordant tune whilst humming. [[Greeba]] shoots him a side glance but he pays no notice. She looks across to the small [[Kenku]] who is scratching strange symbols into the sand with the point of its staff. At a glance they looks like crudely drawn rodents.

As the time draws towards the hour, they see dust gathering far down the western road. A small horse-drawn cart with a canopy approaches. Driving the cart is a common [[Kara|Karran]] boy with a shabby head wrapping. Lounging beneath the canopy is a well-dressed figure with bright blue hair and horn protruding from their forehead.

The cart pulls up and the figure on the back stands up, stretches, and springs down from the back.

> "Here at last! Thanks, kid."

She thumps the side of the cart and waves, indicating that the boy may leave. As the cart pulls away, she turns and flicks her hair, eyeing up the waiting group.

> "So, you're my escort from here onwards?" She cocks her head. "I hope this isn't all we're brining - I can't carry any supplies you know."

She pats a large padded satchel swinging at her side and looks expectantly for a response.

[[Greeba]] steps forwards. She clenches her jaw and lifts a snarl, revealing small tusks that poke from her lower jaw, hidden by the lips.

> "I've got some packs at the tavern. We can pick them up, fill our skins and start planning a route there."

She turns and looks at [[Snake]].

> "I assume you've planned us a route, cat. Unless you want to roam the desert like always."

[[Snake]] shrugs.

> "We will go the ways we must. We must be flexible in the sands of [[Alkhara Desert|Alkhara]]".

[[Greeba]] already begins striding out across the open square, ready to get out of the sun.

The others follow and [[Temitope]] sidles up to [[Snake]].

> "You must be [[Snake]], the navigator? I'm [[Temitope]]. Nice to meet you."

[[Snake]] takes her extended fingers in both of his paw-like hands.

> "A pleasure, miss. I hope we can get well acquainted on this journey. I'm sure we have much to share."
