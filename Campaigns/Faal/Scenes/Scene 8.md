Scene: [[Faal Baelitae]] enters [[Cambroke]] 
Altered: A disturbance outside the town

As Faal approaches the small town, what lies before him is a scattering of small wooden buildings. Two larger halls rise up out of them towards the center. On his right there are plowed fields surrounding an almost out-of-place stone-walled keep  with a square castle tower in the middle. 

As he comes alongside one of the fields that borders the road, there is a gathering of people lining the edge. He walks over to see what's going on. 

`proceed outside`

He joins the people lining the side of the road just as a procession of well dressed people come past, with horses and a cart. There are some armoured individuals among them. 

Faal leans into a human gentleman next to him.

>"Just visiting? Not the best time... These here are the business owners in [[Cambroke]]. The sheriff has just raised taxes on business in town and so they are marching out to set up a barricade at the crossroads, stopping any goods coming in from [[Caustow]]."

Faal thinks of the bodies strewn across the road by [[Friella's Fruits]], hoping no suspicions come his way. 

He leans in again
>"What about traders from the south? I've just come from [[Dunsboles]].
