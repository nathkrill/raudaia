Scene: The port city of [[Caustow]], [[The Pirate & Cauldron]] tavern.

It is late in the evening. The tavern is reaching the peak of it's business and many patrons are sitting around, chatting, eating, drinking, and singing.

In a dark corner with a flickering candle and a small cup, sits [[Faal Baelitae]]. His hood is down and he sits back. To a passing eye he is casually enjoying the tavern's atmosphere. But he is carefully watching and analysing everything in the room.

He stiffens as a new person enters. A halfling woman by the name [[Wenche Clodweed]]. She has long, silvery hair and tan skin. 
He meets her gaze, briefly looking into her emerald eyes. She goes to the bar, pushes past some people and orders a drink.

Faal looks away, pretending to be disinterested. Eventually, she slips into the chair opposite him.

>"Enjoying your evening?"

He waves a hand nonchalantly
>"No need to pretend, Wenche. What's the job?"

>"Straight down to business, eh? No pleasantries for an old friend? It's been a while since you've done any Gathering; what have they had you doing? Bloodletting? Why, that's far too intense for a quiet soul like yourself."

His expression doesn't shift.
>"I do what I'm told to do. Speaking of which..."

>"Okay, okay. Here's the task:"

Wenche goes into a long detail about the history of the nobility here in [[Caustow]]. It's nothing Faal doesn't already know. Piracy, corruption, the lot. A good place for people like him. Then, she gets into some detail.

>"A ship came in last week: The [[Errant of Amak]]. Pirate vessel, nothing unordinary until that entire berth was suddenly locked down by the private guard of [[Kolar Tarryst]]. The Whisperers saw something being escorted off the ship and up to his villa. Heavily guarded. Whatever's in there must be very valuable."

Faal is uninpressed.
>"So that's the mark? Some unknown box off a pirate's haul? C'mon, this is just stealing for the sake of it!"

>"Oh it's not for the sake of it. Half the city wants whatever's in that box! We've got a bidding war on our hands for acquisition. Once we have the thing we can probably triple what's already on the table."

Faal sighs.
>"Okay. Any more info for me? What about the villa?"

>"Your standard rich man house. Walled, gated, guarded. Probably a vault, given the size of the box they carried."

>"Okay, here's the thing - it's big? So how am I going to get it out by myself?"

Wenche grins and puts a small drawstring bag on the table.
>"A new toy come in from the east. In there is a set of 16 amber crystals. Lay them on the ground in a circle and they will encase whatever is inside into a palm-sized hunk of amber. Shatter the gem and the object will be released. Make sure nothing overlaps the circle when you do it - things could get messy."

Faal takes the bag and peers inside. Small chunks of amber gleam back at him. He pockets the bag, finishes his drink and stands up.

>"Well, I'll see you soon. Thanks, Wenche."

She leans back in the chair.
>"Ha! There's the softy I know. Happy Gathering, Faal."
