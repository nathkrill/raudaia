Scene: [[Faal Baelitae]] leaves [[Caustow]]

Faal slips out of the Nest and heads straight to the south end of [[Caustow]], where the road heads towards [[Cambroke]].
Aware of the heat on him at the moment he sticks to the alleys and shadows. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Face Danger](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/face_danger)"
```



He smoothly cuts through the city like a cat, unnoticed and unobstructed. He even manages to blend in with the crowd and out the city gates without being challenged. 

Now out on the road, he relaxed and begins the hike to [[Cambroke]]. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Travel](datasworn:move:homebrew\/custom\/travel)"
```

The road is easy going and Faal takes things casually. He eventually comes to a fork in the road. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Travel](datasworn:move:homebrew\/custom\/travel)"
oracle name="[Travel \/ Travelled with Wits](datasworn:move.oracle_rollable:homebrew\/custom\/travel.wits)" result="You are lost and do not leave this cell" roll=53

```

Faal takes the left fork initially, but reckons he's gone the wrong way and has to turn back around. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Travel](datasworn:move:homebrew\/custom\/travel)"
oracle name="[Travel \/ Travelled with Wits](datasworn:move.oracle_rollable:homebrew\/custom\/travel.wits)" result="Your insight leads you 1 cell in the wrong direction" roll=46

```

As he treks back towards the fork in the road dusk falls heavily. In the dim light Faal completely misses the turning and soon enough he crests a hill and before him is the sea, glistening in the moonlight. The lights of [[Caustow]] glow against the dark edge of the sea. 

>"Dammit!"

Faal stops and looks back in the direction he came. Better to rest now and start again tomorrow. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Make Camp](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/make_camp)"
```

In the morning then sun shines harshly through a thin mist. Faal puts [[Caustow]] behind him and continues on, keeping a sharp eye out for the fork in the road. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Travel](datasworn:move:homebrew\/custom\/travel)"
oracle name="[Travel \/ Hindrances](datasworn:move.oracle_rollable:homebrew\/custom\/travel.hindrance)" result="Something causes you harm. [Endure Harm](datasworn:move:classic\/suffer\/endure_harm)" roll=71

```

Faal is just getting his momentum going when suddenly he hears a crack. A large bough from one of the tropical trees either side of the road breaks away and is plummeting towards him.

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Face Danger](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/face_danger)"
```

Faal dives forwards and manages to just roll out of the way before the branch hits him. That was close!

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Travel](datasworn:move:homebrew\/custom\/travel)"
oracle name="[Travel \/ Opportunities](datasworn:move.oracle_rollable:homebrew\/custom\/travel.opportunity)" result="You find a peaceful place to rest. [Make Camp](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/make_camp) with +1" roll=57

```

After that experience, Faal begins making proper progress on the journey. He takes the right fork off the path and treks on along the road. As the day ends he comes to another fork. There is a small shack nestled between the fork with a sign "[[Friella's Fruits]]. Traveller's welcome".
The shack appears closed but there is a small campfire area. Faal sets up his bedroll. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Make Camp](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/make_camp)"
```

`is Faal ambushed? Yes`

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Gather Information](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/gather_information)"
```

Faal is woken in the night by a rustling and the sounds of footsteps. He rolls over onto his knees. A dark shape comes crashing out of the undergrowth, a large blade in hand. A hooded figure runs towards him, shouting incomprehensibly. 

Faal throws a dagger towards the figure then backs off. 
The dagger strikes and the figure cries out. Faal draws his sword. 

The figure pursues Faal out into the road. Faal turns and draws his rapier, spinning and slashing at his attacker. 

It's then that he sees another figure running out as well. He pulls the dagger out of the dead one and backs up. 

Just as the second one is getting within reach Faal throws the dagger again. 

He finds the mark a second time. This time he dashes off to the side, close to cover. Another figure follows the second out from the shadows.

Both run up to him and he's now surrounded. He takes another rapier strike at the wounded one. The sword goes cleanly through their neck and continues, slicing into the shoulder of the third attacker. 
Faal spins with the blade, getting behind the final attacker and kicks off, sprinting away. 

The figure cries out in pain.
>"You will be cursed in the depths forever!"

They rush headlong to Faal, who simply steps forwards and thrusts the rapier. 

He runs the man through, and he slides to the ground off the end of the sword. 

In the darkness, Faal rummages through the bodies of the figures. They are all wearing matching robes.

`are they from the [[Cult of the Mountains]]? Yes!`

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Gather Information](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/gather_information)"
```

Aside from their curved blades and some basic travel gear, Faal finds on each of them a pouch with a small raw heart inside. Puzzled, Faal leaves the bodies, packs up his camp and decides to keep on his journey. 

`does he get a long rest? Yes`

Before leaving, Faal slams on the door of the small shack and waits. There is no answer.

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Travel](datasworn:move:homebrew\/custom\/travel)"
oracle name="[Travel \/ Hindrances](datasworn:move.oracle_rollable:homebrew\/custom\/travel.hindrance)" result="You witness something harrowing or miserable. [Endure Stress](datasworn:move:classic\/suffer\/endure_stress)" roll=25
```

`Fight exterior`

As Faal carries on down the left-hand fork of the road, he sees some vague shapes in the dense trees. He gets low and follows the bank closely while peering over. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)"
```

What he sees shakes him to his core. A large hulking creature, with a sinewed body and blood red flesh. It's like a huge wolf but turned inside out. It's spine and ribs and bones line the outside of it's skinless body. It's ravenously consuming a small mammal.

Faal holds his breath and tries to get past. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Secure an Advantage](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/secure_an_advantage)"
```

He slips past with ease, continuing into the night. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Travel](datasworn:move:homebrew\/custom\/travel)"
oracle name="[Travel \/ Hindrances](datasworn:move.oracle_rollable:homebrew\/custom\/travel.hindrance)" result="You lose something important. -1 Supply" roll=20

```

Faal is more than a little harrowed by the experience and so his progress slows as he tries to make sure he is totally undetected by whatever else may be out there. 

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Travel](datasworn:move:homebrew\/custom\/travel)"
oracle name="[Travel \/ Opportunities](datasworn:move.oracle_rollable:homebrew\/custom\/travel.opportunity)" result="You find a peaceful place to rest. [Make Camp](datasworn:move:classic\/adventure\/make_camp) with +1" roll=50

```

As dawn breaks over the canopy, Faal approaches the town of [[Cambroke]]. 

Before he gets there, he finds a small spot in a clearing between the trees and marks out a small camp. This is ready if he needs to get away and hide outside town. 

He sits there and eats some breakfast before rejoining the road and heading into town.
