Scene: Faal makes his way to the villa

Faal leaves [[The Pirate & Cauldron]] and steps out into the street. Even though the sun is gone, the night is heavy and warm.
He makes his way through the crowded streets and people spill out of taverns and homes to enjoy tonight's festivities.
The moon beams down, causing the water in the port to sparkle.

Faal decides to head down to the port, and see if he can find anything out about the [[Errant of Amak]] and it's mysterious cargo.

He wanders up and down the docks, but is unable to find the ship or anyone who knows anything about it.

So he turns and starts up the hill towards the district where [[Kolar Tarryst]]'s villa is.

He finds the villa. It's a large, wide building surrounded by a high wall. An ornate iron gate is guarded by two soldiers on either side of the wall.
A courtyard with a fountain goes up to the large front door. A balcony looks out over the city.

`Is anyone home? Yes`

There are lights in the windows, indicating people inside the house.
Faal walks around the back and tries to climb the wall there.

Even as he starts to make his way around, a guard spots him and calls out.
>"You! No hanging about here! Leave this street before I but an arrow in you!" 

His companion draws a bow to highlight the point.

Kaal raises his hands
>"Sorry, I'm a little lost. I was invited to a card game at a friend's house, but his directions were less than helpful. I'm sure he said it was the villa with the walls around it."

`are there other villas around with walls? No`

>"Oh I don't think so. We're not entertaining guests this evening. Now go!"

Kaal backs off and down the street a little.

`Is there a parallel street he can double back behind? Yes`

He makes sure he's out of sight before doubling back behind the house. Now standing at the base of the brick wall, he attempts to climb it.

He gets to the top, and perches for a moment. Then, he quickly leaps to the ground. 

`Are there bushes? Yes`

He pulls himself beneath a bush that lines the corner of the villa at this side. Peering out he sees a rear door at the far end of the house into a conservatory. He leaves the bushes and creeps along the wall.

`Is the room empty? No`

In the conservatory Faal can see a collection of chairs and coffee tables set around an ornate rug. On one of the chaises is a fat, older man asleep.

`Is this [[Kolar Tarryst]]? Yes`

Faal doesn't recognise the man. He tries the door.

`Is it locked? Yes`

He pulls out his tools and picks the lock. He takes a couple of attempts but it eventually opens. 

`Was the door trapped? Yes`

The door opens and a small bell above it rings lightly.

`Does the man awake? Yes`

The man begins to stir. Faal dashes to the other side of the room and out the door there, but the man sees him.

>"Guards! Intruder! Thief! kill him"

Faal is out in a hallway. There are several doors and a set of stairs to the left.

`Are the guards coming from down the hall? Yes`

Faal can hear the sounds of people from almost everywhere. He runs up the stairs.

`Are there guards upstairs? Yes`

He runs right up to two guards!

The guards rush him and attack, but Faal dodges aside.
He swipes the nearest guard with his rapier. As the blade slashes against him, a green flame bursts out and gets the other guard.

Faal jumps and rolls between them, then throws two daggers back.

They sink into the guards' armour. The guards now come together and flail at Faal with their swords. Faal falls back, crouches low and plunges his sword up at throat of the nearest guard. The sword pierces the jaw and goes right up into his skull.

Again, the flame bursts out and catches the other guard. He falls to the ground, his skin charring and hissing.

Faal hasn't got long. He runs from door to door, checking in each for the crate.

`Are there more guards upstairs? No`

```


`Is the crate up here? Yes`

Faal bursts into a large room. It's kind of like a dance hall, with mirrors on the walls. In the centre is a large crate.

`Was the door trapped? Yes`

As he steps into the room, Faal is assaulted by a loud squeal which penetrates his brain.

```iron-vault-mechanics
oracle name="Will [[Campaigns\/Faal\/Clocks\/Scene 2- Guards upstairs.md|Scene 2- Guards upstairs]] advance? (Almost certain)" result="Yes" roll=11 {
    clock from=0 name="[[Campaigns\/Faal\/Clocks\/Scene 2- Guards upstairs.md|Scene 2- Guards upstairs]]" out-of=6 to=1
}
```

He is frozen for a moment, then the effect ends. He rushes over to the crate and pulls out the pouch of amber.

He quickly throws out the amber in a circle around the crate. After a second it begins to glow, then there is a bright flash and the crate and amber pieces are gone! Sitting in the centre of where the circle was is a chunk of solid amber. Faal grabs it, puts it in the pouch and runs out the room.

Out in the corridor he hears the sounds of guards coming from the staircase he entered. So he runs down the length of the corridor and around the corner.

`Is there another staircase?  No`

The corridor ends around the corner with another door. 

`Is it locked? Yes`

The door is locked and Faal doesn't have time to pick it. So, he swings his sword hilt at a window.

The window smashes open. Faal looks out and sees the bushes he hid in earlier below, and the wall beyond. He jumps down into the bushes. 

He lands softly in the bushes and runs to the wall, leaping up to it. He effortlessly flies over it and lands with momentum, sprinting down the street and into the night.
