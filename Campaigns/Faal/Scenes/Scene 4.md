Scene: Faal goes to the Order
Altered: [[Wenche Clodweed|Wenche]] comes to Faal

[[Faal Baelitae]] is woken in the morning by the sound of someone coming up the ladder. He rolls over and grabs a dagger, crouching over the loft hatch.

[[Wenche Clodweed]]'s tan face and emerald eyes appear at the opening of the hatch. Faal relaxes and rolls over, letting the dagger fall.

>"Hey, [[Wenche Clodweed|Wenche]]. You came to find me - what, were you worried?"

Wenche awkwardly finds a spot opposite him on the pillows.
>"Worried about my mission, more like. Sounds like you made a bit of a mess of things over there. There were guards from all over swarming into the [[Caustow#The Highgate|The Highgate]]. It nearly ruined a number of jobs we had going on up there!"

Faal shrugs.
>"I guess it wasn't the smoothest it could have been. But I got the crate. Stored up in the amber, like you asked."

>"Good. Let's get down to the Nest and take a look."

Wenche leads Faal down the ladder and out into the street. The sun is shining, and gulls fly overhead. The common folk are out and about doing their business in the morning.

They go out, each pulling up a hood in the daylight to avoid being noticed or identified easily.

They head right onto the docks, where they walk out onto a wooden platform which hangs over the quay. At the far end of the rickety surface is a collection of crates and boxes, lined up to hide a small rope ladder which descends below the street.
At the bottom of that is a floating pontoon which goes along to a just-tall-enough sewer grate with a gate built into it.
Wenche opens the gate and they step into the sewer with the odorous water sloshing about their feet.
The sewer continues deep into the city, but Wenche stops at a water gate with a heavy iron wheel built into it. She takes out a small iron token and slots it into the front of the wheel. It clicks into place and she begins to turn the wheel. There is the grinding of metal on metal until she stops and pushes the water gate inwards. It slowly moves in and she holds it in place as Faal steps within.

It's drier in here, but the smell lingers a little. But as they go along the dark passage towards light, the acrid smell of the sewer slowly fades into a rich incense.

They come out into a large circular chamber, the size of a market square. There are braziers lit along the walls and various rugs and wooden floors put down over the sewer stones.
Around the chamber are several wooden doors leading off to various chambers. There are tables and desks, some with papers, others with coins and goods. Dark-clothed individuals are seated or standing around the desks, arranging the business of [[The Order of Eye and Tooth]].
It's a familiar sight to Faal, one he's only seen once since returning to [[Caustow]].

Wenche strides across the room and through one of the doors. It leads into a section of tunnels splitting off like tree branches. She takes one and leads Faal into an empty stone chamber.

There is straw lightly lining the floor and a small opening high in the curved stone brick ceiling lets in a small amount of light. A thick candle by the door fills the rest of the room with it's warm glow.

Wenche closes and bolts the door.
>"This should be big enough. C'mon, let's see what you got."

Faal nods and steps out into the middle of the room. He takes out the pouch and the amber within it. He holds it up. Gleaming in the crystal is a faint image, almost a reflection of a large wooden crate.

He looks a Wenche, then throws the gem away to the ground. It shatters with the same orange flash and the shards of amber explode out. There in the empty room there is now the large crate.
Faal walks around, picking up the shards and putting them back into the pouch.

Wenche steps up to the crate, lays her hands on it and begins inspecting it. It's a basic shipping crate, held together with nails and a lid.

`is it trapped? yes`

>"There's a trap trigger in the lid. Be a dear Faal and disarm it."

Faal looks at her as if to say "can't you do it?", but goes up to it and gets to work.

It's not easy work - Faal struggles with the tools which keep getting caught on the rough edges of the wooden crate. But eventually he manages to unpin the wire that would trigger the trap when the crate is opened. He steps back to let Wenche open the crate.

She laughs
>"I know we're friends, but you know I'd never trust anyone *that* much."

She puts her hand in his back and pushes him forward.

Faal reluctantly gets out his crowbar and pries open the wooden lid. It pops off and slides to the ground, kicking up dust and straw.
Faal peers inside. The crate is lined with straw which he pulls off the top. Nestled inside the crate is...

A large rock.

Faal looks confused and leans in closer. Wenche steps up to see as well.

>"A rock? What's the fuss behind that?"

Faal inspects it closer. He takes a dagger and taps it gently. The rocks gives off a quiet "ping" and vibrates slightly.

>"It's some kind of metal ore. Nothing I'm familiar with, though. I expect it's rare and valuable if [[Kolar Tarryst]] went to so much trouble over it."

Wenche looks closely as well.
>"I think you're right. I'll get the [[The Order of Eye and Tooth#Whisperers|Whisperers]] and [[The Order of Eye and Tooth#Gifters|Gifters]] on it. Someone out there must know what this is."

Faal steps back and folds his arms.
>"Well, you know what comes next."

Wenche's glittering eyes catch his with a smile.
>"Of course, here!"

She tosses him a token - a silver tooth with an eye engraved on it.
>"A job complete. You made a bit of mess, but I'm happy with what we have here. Thanks, Faal."

Faal nods.
>"A pleasure. Until next time."

He unbolts the door and heads back out into the central chamber. There he queues at a desk and eventually is greeted by a human male, similar age to him but a little more wiry and pale.

>"[[Deme]], it's good to see you again!"

The man looks up from the papers in front of him.

>"Ah! Faal. Back again so soon. Another job complete?"

Faal puts the token down on the table.
>"That's right, nice and quick."

>"Just how you like it! Okay, so one token... Here you go!"

He reaches into the cupboard beneath his desk and takes out a coin purse and sets it down on the table. He then picks up the token between finger and thumb and carefully places it in a small lockbox, which he then locks.

Faal takes the purse and puts it in his bag. 
>"What's that put me up to?"

[[Deme]] is making a tally in a book on the table with his quill. He runs his finger along.

>"Let's see... So with this one, that makes 10 successful missions, for a total of 12 tokens. You're moving up friend, there's no doubt of that!"

[[Deme]] closes the book as Faal leans in to take a look.

>"Well, off with you now! There's a queue, remember."

Faal looks around and acknowledges the queue of hooded and leathered people behind him. He waves and walks away.
