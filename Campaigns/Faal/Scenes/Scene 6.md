Scene: [[Faal Baelitae]] goes back to the safe house 
Interrupt: PC positive, arrive project 

Faal is just about to head out of the Nest to the dockside exit when [[Wenche Clodweed]] rushes through the crowd shouting his name. 

>"Faal! Hey!"

He stops and lets her catch up to him. 
>"Just a second. You picked up a new job?"
She pants.

>"That's right. Heading off to [[Cambroke]] once I'm ready."

>"Ah yes, the soldier. You'll have fun with that one.
>But I was wondering if you could do something else for me?"

Faal thinks for a second. 
>"If there's a token in it, you know I'll do anything."

```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Compel](datasworn:move:classic\/relationship\/compel)"
```

Wenche is taken aback. 

>"A token? Really? Is that how you treat your friends?"

Faal gives in. 
>"Ok fine, what do you need?"

Wenche shuffles awkwardly.
>"Well, there's a friend of mine. She lives in [[Cliford]]. Normally we write to each other regularly, but she hasn't written back in ages. None of my contacts in the town have seen here either. I can't go over there, but it would mean a lot of you could pop by and check if she's okay."

>"[[Cliford]]? That's the opposite direction to where I'm going!"
Faal looks at Wenche. She seems uncharacteristically moved by this situation. 
He sighs. 
>"Okay, I'll do it."

Wenche grabs his arm. 
>"Thanks. I appreciate it Faal. Good luck in [[Cambroke]]."

She presses a note into his hand with a name and house then heads back through to her chambers.
