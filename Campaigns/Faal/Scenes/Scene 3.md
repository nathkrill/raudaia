Scene: locating the order hideout
Altered scene: locating faal's safehouse

Faal winds his way through the streets, heading back dockwards.
It seems word of the disturbance at [[Kolar Tarryst]]'s house has got out as there are guards from various groups combing the streets, all heading up the hill.

Faal keeps to the shadows and eventually leaves the district. 

>"I shouldn't head straight to the Order. Let's wait for the heat to die down and go there tomorrow."
He thinks to himself.

He tries to find his old safehouse - a small apartment he kept for himself back when he was here more often.

It's very easy to find, he knows this part of the city well. To the east of the city is a small shanty-town of wooden buildings and huts known as the [[Caustow#Darkway|Darkway]]. Faal finds the ramshack abode and slides a wooden panel off the side, revealing a ladder. Climbing the ladder he crawls into the loft space apartment, with a sloping wood-beam roof and dusty blankets and pillows.
He pulls a candle out of a wonky drawer set and lights it. In the dim but warm loft, he relaxes and falls asleep.
