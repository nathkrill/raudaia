Scene: [[Faal Baelitae]] looks for a new job

Faal heads around to try to find [[Mireille Soria]], the local master of Whisperers. He finds the passage which leads to her lofty nook.

It's a cramped room with a large desk along one wall. Along all the other walls as well as above the desk are shelves crammed full of folders and documents. There are papers all over her desk and she sits in a chair intently reading a book.

Faal gently knocks on the door.
>"Mireille?"

She looks up intently. She's an older human, with cropped wavy black hair and wrinkles and bags around her dark eyes. She's paler than most in this region, and speaks with a northern accent.
>"Huh? Oh Faal, come in! What can I do for you?"

Fall steps around piles of books and notes and leans against the desk at a corner where there is less clutter.

>"Just wanting to know about the fallout from yesterdays' job. How are things out there? Is it safe for me to take another job or should I lay low?"

[[Mireille Soria]] immediately starts flicking back in a notebook she picks up off the desk.
>"Ah yes, I got a report earlier this morning. Let me take a look..."

`Are things safe enough? big no`

>"Hmm... Looks like you caused quite a stir. As well as the noble's milita they have gotten the [[Caustow]] guard involved as well.
>I don't think you were recognised specifically - there's no drawings of your face hanging around. But heat is high in the town in general. I expect most jobs this week to be out-of-town jobs."

Faal sighs.
>"Just as I get back into town I have to leave again? At least, if I want to get paid that is..."

Mireille shrugs.
>"Next time, do the job quietly eh?"

She turns back into her book and waves Faal away.

Fall heads down from her loft and back into the main chamber of the Nest. Things are getting busier as the day moves on and he picks his way through the crowd to the job board.

The job board is a large stone pillar off to one side of the main chamber. The pillar is covered from base to ceiling with metal spikes protruding from it. Hanging from the spikes are many thick paper tags with dark ink scrawlings on them. They read like so:
"Bloodlet, Stansin, 2 tokens", or "Gather, Norton, 1 token". Fastened to the back of the tags are small scrolls which contain further details of the job.

Faal pushes through the many Order members who are intently scanning the tags, and begins searching for a tag that is close by, and worth more than just the basic 1 token.

He finds the following:

>"Bloodlet, Westcke, 2 tokens"
>"Gather, Cambroke, 1 token"

Not keen on doing any Bloodletting right now, Faal grabs for the Gather card.

`is he the only one interested? Yes`

He takes it off the hook and turns and walks away. Off against one of the curved sloping walls is a small fenced off bar area. Faal goes and finds a stool before opening the rolled parchment.

>"Find [[Jane Halliwell|Jane]] at the barracks in [[Cambroke]] for an object retrieval job. Receive 1 token from client upon satisfactory completion."

Faal considers the job. 1 token isn't much, but [[Cambroke]] is close enough that he can do this quickly. He pockets the note and makes his way out from the Nest.
