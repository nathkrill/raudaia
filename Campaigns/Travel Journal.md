## Waypoint 1: Oasis

[[Carandel]] is walking through the desert, north of [[Dhanahraf]]. The heat of the sun bears down on him. He takes the last drop of his waterskin and wipes his sweaty brow.
In the distance he sees a small collection of steep dunes in a circle. There is the slight top of a spiky tree poking out above them.
He goes to investigate and climbs up a dune. He looks down upon a dazzling oasis!
Grazing and drinking at the pool are a group of [[Dhamf]].
He sits and watches them quietly as they graze, their breaks and long tongues splashing in the water. 
Small birds with long, thin legs stand on the rocky backs of these creatures, pecking at small bugs and weeds that gather in the cracks.
The [[Dhamf]] calmly ignore the birds - this is clearly a partially symbiotic relationship. They graze lazily, not paying much attention around them and chirping amicably to each other. They don't notice [[Carandel]].
He waits for them to gather and eventually speed off into the distance before making his own way down the dune to rest and replenish at the luscious pool.

> "The oasis homes of the [[Dhamf]] are warm, yet luscious places. After cooling off from the harsh sun in the dazzling pools, it is wonderful to lie in the shade of the trees on the warm sand and let the respite do wanders to one's countenance. The [[Dhamf]] themselves are gracious hosts, allowing observation from a distance, but not staying too long so as to be selfish of these life-giving spaces."

## Waypoint 2: Glass Crater

In the distance to the south, [[Carandel]] sees a shining blue glow. The glinting of something reflecting the sun. Shading his eyes, he heads towards it.
It gets brighter as he approaches, dazzling in the eyes like a pile of a thousand diamonds.

He comes upon a vast crater, with large spires and spikes rising up aorund the edges. The ground and structures here are made entirely of a shiny blue glass. This is the [[Azraq Crater]]. The sheer size and colorful glow that this emits in the sunlight startles [[Carandel]] and fills him with awe. What immense power could have created such a place?

To get in, there are a mix of ladders and steps carved into the exterior slopes, eventually going right up to the jagged top edge. [[Carandel]] sees deep in the central hole of the crater - a perfectly circular pit - there are small huts and scaffolds constructed. From the edge they seem like tiny ants scurrying around. The slight sound of chisels and picks echo around. This crater is being mined for the precious blue glass.
As [[Carandel]] walks along the sometimes smooth, sometimes rough and shard-covered terrain, he meets some of these people. They are dry, hardy people. Mostly [[Rafah|Raffan]], they wear thick leather clothes to protect from the shards and sharp edges. A lot of them also have thick iron eye covers with sack over to protect their eyes from the glare.
Closer to the centre, where the ground is a little more flat around the edge of the pit, [[Carandel]] enters more of a residential area, with small huts and tents. Here there are families. Many of the people here wear jewellery made out of the blue glass. There are stands where they sell crafted pieces, or find dust powder ground out of the glass.
It seems that the powder has some magical property - there are many wizards at these particular stands buying large quantities. [[Carandel]] meets an envoy of the [[Council of the Mystics]].
The head of the mining operating is, unsurprisingly, a dwarf team who direct the [[Rafah]] in their work.

The pit is lined with scaffolds for mining the glass, as well as smaller holes dotted around the flat ground.
Whether caused by the mining work or not, there are large cracks spreading out from the central pit. Within these are yet more scaffolds.
At the edges there are huge piles of glass rubble being cleared away, where a pillar or spike has collapsed. [[Carandel]] learns that the cracks and collapses do not happen too often, but are always in the back of the mind of the leaders of this operation.

[[Carandel]] is shown a closeup view of one of the cracks. It is a sheer drop deep down into a glassy chasm and so the workers are all harnessed to large metal stakes at the rim. Looking down into the chasm, the light diffuses out, reflecting all the way down into a bright glow somewhere at the bottom.

> "The beauty of this enormous glass crater is as dazzling as the sunlight that reflects off it. I am struck by the sheer power of force that would create such an impact.
> I bought a pendant with a bead of the glass at the end - like a teardrop."

## Waypoint 3: [[Alkhablah]]

A long hike back north brings [[Carandel]] to the town of [[Alkhablah]]. As [[Carandel]] approaches the town, he is struck by lively noises coming from the center.
At the outskirts, the place seems to be empty, but as he goes further in, [[Carandel]] beings to see people all heading towards the center and there he joins a large throng.
The crowds are close and noisy, and in the desert heat it is hard to stand among them. [[Carandel]] follows the lead of some like-minded people and goes inside a building, then up onto the roof for an unobstructed view.

It is immediately clear that this is some kind of festival. The people here are wearing bright, expensive clothing. There is music, dancing, food, and drinking.
The music is largely rhythmic, and there are different cheers and shouts. There doesn't seem to be much singing. [[Carandel]] learns that in [[Rafah]] culture, songs are reserved for solemn occasions - as ways of expressing painful emotions more easily.
Speaking to someone else on the roof, [[Carandel]] learns that this is the festival of [[Mazhur]], the celebration of the appearance of [[Falah]] deep in the desert. This is only the 6th year since the arrival of their mysterious god atop a mountain.

[[Alkhablah]] is the central point for this celebration in this region because of it's size and proximity to the mountain. Many of the [[Rafah]] who do not belong to the nomadic herds that gather deeper in the desert will come here to celebrate. There are four inns as well as a large castle, which is reserved for special guests.

[[Carandel]] notices the inclusion of eggs in this celebration. Eggs of different sizes are used in different ways during the festival. A lot of egg-based food is consumed, all the decorations are egg-like in their presentation, and some of the festival-goers are wearing large egg hats upon their head, adorned with beads and gems.
[[Carandel]] knows that [[Falah]] manifest in the form of a large egg on the mountain, but he is surprised that they use this symbology in their celebration!
He is offered some egg treats. There are some regular chicken eggs, larger eggs from the desert bird [[Neama]], and some delightful sweet, colorful eggs from the [[Siqaya]].

The smell of various incense, mixed with sweat and cooked food is quite overwhelming. He is handed a fragrant tea called [[Kark]] which helps to lighten the load on his senses.
