# Wenche Clodweed

Wenche is a female halfling Gatherer for [[The Order of Eye and Tooth]] in [[Caustow]].

She has long silver hair, which covers her slight frame. She has sparking emerald eyes and is notable missing an ear.

She tasked [[Faal Baelitae]] with recovery of a mysterious item from the possession of [[Kolar Tarryst]], which turned out to be a strange metal ore neither of them had seen before.
